											<p>Young single women in the Orthodox Church don&#8217;t stay single for long. Since the ratio of young men to women is so high, it doesn&#8217;t take long for single women to be taken off the market. As Orthodox men calculate their prospects, a common question is asked: &#8220;How can I attract a woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past, I developed a lifestyle around answering this question. It inevitably involved transforming myself into a man I thought women would be attracted to. I exaggerated my strengths, concealed my weaknesses, lied without ceasing, uprooted myself to locations where it was easier to meet women, and engaged in numerous sins to win over a woman&#8217;s fleeting affections. I can&#8217;t help but chafe when a man asks me how to attract a woman because&#8212;without spiritual considerations&#8212;the answer that &#8220;works&#8221; is to deceive and manipulate.</p>
<p>To attract a woman, one can mimic the approach of the Protestant Churches and be &#8220;seeker sensitive.&#8221; You could identify your target (the woman), find out her desires, and then mold yourself to satisfy them, even if that&#8217;s not who you are. You become a phony to, at the minimum, lie by omission so that she becomes attracted to the &#8220;best version of yourself.&#8221; You toss overboard the useful but socially mundane gifts that God has given you and instead summon qualities you don&#8217;t possess so that the women of this evil age lust after you. If they like a muscular man and you are puny, you hit the gym with urgent zeal. If they like a funny man and you are not, you practice comedy. If they like a &#8220;bad boy&#8221; but you are not, you must insinuate that you are a great sinner (if you served time in jail, that would be a plus in their eyes!). The whole idea of wanting to attract a woman presupposes that your current state is not attractive, and that you must transform both your physique and personality into that which pleases a woman to satisfy her in a carnal manner while using the flimsy pretext that it is all being doing for &#8220;spiritual&#8221; reasons.</p>
<p>Can you not already see how seeking to attract women makes an idol out of them? We are supposed to transform ourselves into children of God through prayer, obedience, and worship, and we attempt that with hardly any vigor, but when it comes to being liked by a woman, we are ready to change ourselves wholesale to be with a female creature who was made in <em>our</em> image. Indeed, wanting to attract a woman <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/men-treat-women-as-gods">inverts the natural order</a>, because we were made in the image of God and women <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A21-22&amp;version=NKJV">were made in the image of man</a>. Before you even meet her, by possessing a desire to win her over, you&#8217;ve already stepped foot into the pit. Without even knowing it, and in the most subtle of ways, she will control you as long as the ensuing relationship lasts, directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Attempting to attract a woman through techniques or tactics is secular behavior, and I know this because I did it <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/8-personal-defects-that-allowed-me-to-worship-fornication-for-18-years">for nearly two decades</a>, and learned exclusively how to do so from secular sources. There is nothing Christian about modifying your essence and nature to be more pleasing to women than God while they are busy modifying their essence and nature to be more pleasing to men than God. There is nothing Christian about becoming handsome or socially astute through effort in order to excite a woman, to be vainglorious to attract the vainglorious. No, you do those things not to please God but to please yourself through the female flesh. I wholeheartedly condemn all efforts at &#8220;self-improvement&#8221; or &#8220;transformation&#8221; where the aim of your effort is to attract a woman instead of serve God. Men who are desperate to find a wife think they must attract a woman to please God when really they must please God so that He sends them a suitable woman. Surely it is better to evaluate a woman that God sends you versus one you met using sales tactics while talking to dozens of women on internet apps so that maybe one desires the result of your false transformation enough to get into a relationship with you.</p>
<p>The correct question to ask is this: How can I <em>identify</em> a woman who recognizes my love for Lord Jesus Christ? Instead of manually attracting a woman through superficial changes that clash with your God-given qualities and gifts, you instead use your eyes and ears to identify the one woman who wants you to lead her with faith. Notice the word &#8220;one.&#8221; You don&#8217;t need to attract a lot of women: you only need to find one woman who sees your own attraction for Christ. This means you can come across thousands of women who discard you as if you were trash, who do not see your love for God and call you all sorts of insulting names, and you will be tempted to fall into despair to think that no woman will ever love you, and be tempted to inject yourself with testosterone and wear cool skinny jeans like they do in Sweden, but you should deny that instinct, stay true to the faith, and wait for God to enlighten a woman that you are her match, and to enlighten you that she is your match, because <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/secular-marriage-vs-christian-marriage">an Orthodox marriage</a> is not a sales drive or a numbers game, but a game of patience and faith where we put our full trust in God to deliver what we need for our salvation and the salvation of others.</p>
<p>It is infinitely better for you to do a prostration to please God than a rep <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/4-reasons-why-lifting-in-gyms-is-a-bad-idea">at the bench press</a> to please a woman. It is better to make a spontaneous prayer glorifying God when you behold a beautiful mountain or vista than to make a worldly joke that you hope will make a woman laugh. It is better to shed tears of repentance at your sins than to puff out your chest to make a woman think you are an alpha male. I did all the latter and have nothing to show for it but darkness and sin. If you don&#8217;t think that you can get married using God alone, without tips and advice from the secular world of which I once preached, then you have not a woman problem but a <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/gods-revelation-to-the-human-heart">spiritual problem</a>.</p>
<p>Allow me to predict your future if you go on trying to attract a woman outside of the clean waters of the Church. In order to transform yourself into an &#8220;attractive&#8221; man, you will create a fantasy persona and wade into the sewage of the world, of dating apps and the like, and get the attention of a lukewarm woman who likes your personality, your skin-deep transformation, who transformed herself to attract a man and uses no less deception than you. You may enter a relationship with her, a pseudo-courtship infused with secular behaviors, because she was on the app after all and demands physical and emotional pleasure like all other women on the app, but you will rationalize to yourself that you&#8217;re doing God&#8217;s will and all will be fine. After some time passes, you become tired of wearing the mask, of being someone you&#8217;re not, but she is attracted to the mask, the false persona, the man full of self-pride and self-will, and you are scared to take it off because the pleasure and validation her affections give you will be withdrawn. Soon her secular flaws become more glaring as your attempt to flirt-to-convert her into the Church reveals that she&#8217;s only converting because she wants to receive the secular benefits of being a married woman, not because she wants to worship God in his True Church. You&#8217;re overly committed and don&#8217;t want to lose her. You fall for the false despairing notion that no other woman will love you due to your impatience and lack of trust in God. You decide to marry her before she flees into the arms of another man. How many good years will you have until the expensive bill comes due? I&#8217;ve seen this bill with my own eyes concerning other men, and let me tell you, this is a bill that is so expensive that no man can pay it in full. The payment plan lasts for the rest of your life, and if that&#8217;s God&#8217;s will for you then so be it, but I fail to see how using deception to hunt for secular women who were never serious about the faith in the first place is what God ordains for Orthodox men.</p>

<p>My advice for men essentially boils down to &#8220;be yourself,&#8221; but with a huge caveat: you are like Christ. Be yourself where yourself is Christ, who the Church <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/how-to-live-a-holy-life">teaches us to be like</a>, and identify a woman who wants to cleave into one flesh with an icon of Christ, of which you will be upon marriage as you establish a &#8220;little church&#8221; in your family home. What additional advice do you need in this case? You need to be a man with basic strength, courage, and communication ability. You need to notice when a woman stares at you for more than two seconds or when she asks around about you, and petition God to help you meet this woman and get to know her and discern if she could be your wife. That&#8217;s it! If you think I&#8217;m exaggerating, this is all I&#8217;m using in my own life, for anything else will kindle my passions and undoubtedly lead to sin. While I have reams of secular experience with women, and can analyze their behavior on the most minute level, it&#8217;s only useful when giving advice to other men in various stages of relationship difficulty, usually with women enflamed with worldly desires. For myself, however, I use my senses to identify which woman is interested in me and then my brain to discern her level of faith and then my heart to lean on God for help, because no matter how much experience you have with women, you will never see inside her soul and know for sure if she&#8217;s the one. It is effortless for her to pretend to be someone she&#8217;s not, whether subconsciously or otherwise, and since women are more socially advanced than men, you will be tricked and end up marrying a stranger, but know that God can see into her soul, and He knows who she really is, so don&#8217;t listen to me or other men when evaluating a particular woman: lean on God instead.</p>
<p>If you make googly eyes with a pretty woman and think to yourself how you can attract her, you&#8217;ve already lost. You&#8217;ve made her a false idol and have decided to trust your eyes and fallen flesh more than God. I pity you because you remind me of myself! You&#8217;re already in the pit and don&#8217;t know it. Through your weak faith and self-trust, you are about to make this woman into your god, and your inevitable fall may shatter you. I wish I can relay to you all the horror stories I&#8217;ve seen and heard that sum up thusly: the more desperate a man is to cleave to a secular woman, the more painful the outcome will be. It&#8217;s possible you may get an adorable child or two from it, but there will never be peace for them if the home is broken, and there is a high chance they will grow up to be broken themselves, and every day will be full of regret. Wake up, Christian man! A woman is not your God! Do not attempt to attract anything besides the grace of God within <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/how-to-join-the-orthodox-church">His Orthodox Church</a>, because you will be surely chastised, as I have been chastised, of wasting most of your life with secular women who keep your eyes away from God and onto the pleasures of your body and the feeding of your will and pride. Love God and simply wait for a woman who sees your love and wants to love God the way you do, and then you&#8217;ll have a good chance, and God will be with you. Whatever cross we have to bear in this life, whether it be a painful marriage, divorce, singledom, or something else we can&#8217;t foresee, may God give us the strength to bear it so that we retain our Orthodox faith until the end.</p>

											<p>I have an overactive imagination. Not an hour of the day goes by when I don&#8217;t insert myself into a future that is not yet realized. Such a faculty may be useful for some aspects of creative work, but most of my fantasies are not directed on a specific outcome. Instead, I&#8217;m led astray by my imaginative faculty when I&#8217;m trying to undertake normal tasks like reading, writing, or listening, and it regularly distracts me when I should be serving God with zeal and vigor. I&#8217;m often in a fantasy land that creates an escape from my Christian duties.</p>
<p>What is imagination? Unlike a distinct memory, a relic of something that has already happened, an imagination (or fantasy) is something that has not yet been realized in material existence. You are using your mind to conjure a scene, situation, or outcome that&#8212;at the current moment&#8212;is fiction. Therefore, imagination is future-oriented, whereas a memory, whether enjoyable or not, is past-oriented. Your ability to recall memories is limited by the fixed limitation of memories, but with imagination, there is no limit to what you can invoke. Taken to the extreme, imagination may lead to a complete break from reality.</p>
<p>Orthodox <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/teachings-of-the-church-fathers">Church Fathers</a> state that imagination comes from the <em>nous</em>, which is the eye of the soul. The more damaged your soul, and the further you are from Lord Jesus Christ, the worse your fantasies will be, to the point where they cause you to sin and completely intrude on the ability to have a normal adult life.</p>
<blockquote><p>…imagination is one of the faculties of the soul that plays an important role in the action and development of passions. It forms the image of a person or thing within us, then provokes sensual pleasure to capture our nous. Once taken captive we commit sin.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Since the Fall man&#8217;s imaginative faculty has run wild and is full of fantasies. Apart from man, the devil also has imagination. For precisely this reason fantasy and imagination are an efficient conductor of satanic energy and the devil uses them to ensnare people. Fantasy and imagination are a bridge between man and the demons, which the demons cross to trouble him.</p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="https://thoughtsintrusive.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/the-imaginative-faculty-fantasy-imagination/">Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos</a></p></blockquote>
<p>When classifying imagination, I noticed two variables that determine the severity of one&#8217;s disconnection from reality. The first variable is the proximity of the fantasy. Does it take place in the next hour or does it take place in a faraway future? The second variable is the likelihood that the fantasy will happen. Are you imagining the conversation you will have with your friend as you are driving to his home or are you fantasizing about being a world-famous singer? If the imagined event is proximal and likely to happen, your fantasy can possibly be described as a rehearsal, but if it is distant and not likely to happen, your fantasy may be a dangerous form of delusion.</p>
<p>Here are five types of imagination that I have noticed myself doing&#8230;</p>
<h3>1. Things right about to happen</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16061" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/job-interview-male-woman.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>A type of imagination that I&#8217;ve never heard labeled as dangerous is rehearsing for an event that will soon happen. Examples include same-day preparation for a speech, job interview, sporting performance, work meeting, or difficult conversation with a spouse. You mentally arrange the pieces of what is right about to happen to increase the likelihood of success. Such imagination may include logistical planning, dry runs, and scheduling.</p>
<p>To write this article, I had to imagine various ideas and test them in my mind before committing them to paper. My imagination was focused, deliberate, practical, and based on a reality that I wanted to perform. Most jobs require this mode of imagination.</p>
<p>One limitation of this type of imagination is when conversing with others. If you already prepare what you&#8217;re going to say to someone, or what advice you&#8217;re going to give, you may neglect to listen to new information or perceive the shifting needs of the listener and end up speaking at them instead of with them. It&#8217;s easy to turn spontaneous conversations into a lecture through excessive rehearsal and planning.</p>
<h3>2. Things that are likely to happen soon</h3>
<p>We now extend the timeline to things that are planned for the future but which may not happen. Last year, I was booked for a speaking event in Atlanta. I drafted a speech with the expectation I would deliver it, and imagined speaking before the crowd, but the event was cancelled by multiple venues. Another time, I planned to visit my friend <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/11-things-i-learned-from-living-on-the-blue-ridge-mountains-for-2-months">in the mountains</a>. I imagined some topics I was going to talk to him about, but my car broke down and I could not go. Another time, I imagined making vegan banana pancakes and the joy I would get from eating them, but my mom ate all the bananas and I could not make them.</p>
<p>In this category, we&#8217;re starting to see a failure in the realization of our imaginations, even though the failure is unexpected. After all, you did expect the event to occur, and wanted to be prepared for it. I wonder if the most useful aspect of our imaginative faculty is simply helping us prepare for common tasks so that we can give and receive the most spiritual value from them.</p>
<h3>3. Things that are unlikely to happen anytime soon</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16062" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-superhero-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>The more spiritually sick a person is, the more he is dominated by all kinds of fantasy and imagination. The healthier he is spiritually, the freer he is from fantasies and imaginings. Even what are referred to nowadays as psychological problems are produced and retained in our souls by fantasies. The more we are freed from their oppression, the more we are healed from various psychological problems. This is why St John Cassian the Roman writes that a sign that someone has acquired the virtue of holiness and chastity is that his soul pays no attention at all to imagination or fantasy, even when asleep. &#8212;Ibid</p></blockquote>
<p>With this category, we&#8217;re beginning to escape from reality, because we imagine things that&#8212;even if realized&#8212;won&#8217;t happen for a long time. There becomes a huge gap between the present time and when the fantasy can occur. For example, a man may meet a pretty woman and then later imagine her as his wife, or what it would be like to be intimate with her. A woman may get a haircut and imagine a handsome man who will sweep her off her feet because he <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/worldy-beauty-vs-graceful-beauty">finds her so ravishing</a>. An unemployed computer programmer may imagine being a top executive at a prestigious firm. A single woman may imagine the names of her future children and how beautiful they will be.</p>
<p>Pleasure has begun to seep into the fantasy. The fantasizer disconnects from a boring reality and imagines a future that is pleasurable and more gratifying on the ego, just like how a drug addict ingests a drug to go somewhere else with his mind and body. He doesn&#8217;t like how his life is at the current moment so he imagines a better one in the future, which in turn causes him to neglect the present reality.</p>
<p>Prevalent are fantasies of the flesh. Unfortunately, I have spent untold hours with these types of fantasies in my secular days, which enabled my addiction to carnal living. The fantasies become the main fuel to engage in lawlessness. Fantasies can also exist on the complete opposite end of the spectrum where you imagine catastrophes, traumas, and other bad events that lead to anxiety, despondency, and despair, feelings that tear you away from the Lord.</p>
<h3>4. Lofty fantasies that will <em>never</em> happen</h3>
<blockquote><p>Since the greatest and most terrible passion of all is pride, fantasy and imagination are closely linked with pride. Someone who is proud has something wrong with his imaginative faculty. It is inflamed. It conceives all kinds of images and fantasies and makes his soul an earthquake zone. &#8212;Ibid</p></blockquote>
<p>The previous category had a <em>shred</em> of connection to reality, but now the fantasies become completely void of realism. For example, a man may imagine himself as president of a great empire while deliberating all the excellent laws he should pass, maybe even writing them down. Another man may imagine himself as a hero in a train accident, where his actions save dozens of lives. A woman may imagine herself as a saint who lived centuries ago. A timid man may imagine telling off a politician or policeman to a cheering crowd. A woman may imagine herself as inventing a cure for cancer and winning the Nobel Prize. These fantasies usually involve receiving adoration from a mob, absolute power, or a level of worldwide fame for nonexistent talents or virtues.</p>
<p>I admit that I have delved into this category more often than I like to admit. My insane pride has effortlessly led me to exalted fantasies where I was placed above all men to receive rapturous attention from the most beautiful women in the world. Someone can be especially prone to these fantasies if they are &#8220;bored&#8221; with their lives and want to add excitement or ego gratification without ever leaving their computer chair.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this category of imagination allows a person to believe that they are someone they&#8217;re not. Their entitlement grows and they begin to detach from reality. They fail to empathize with those who are &#8220;beneath&#8221; them in their fantasies, and in heightened states of delusion, they may actually believe their fantasies are truth. If you are experiencing this level of imagination, your soul has likely experienced heavy damage <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/secular-success-vs-christian-success">from secular life</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Vivid dreams, visions, and outright delusion</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16063" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-fantasy-delusion-fog-shadow-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Dreams are fantasies, and they relate to the passions existing within us. From the images in these fantasies we can discern which passions we have.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It is noticeable that studying the writings of the holy Fathers crucifies the imagination, whereas reading impassioned writings, especially fiction, excites the imagination. The Fathers never concerned themselves with so-called Christian fiction, narrative tales and so on, because that sort of writing provokes fantasy. By contrast, even poetry written by the saints has an element of repentance and theoria of God. The poems of St Symeon the New Theologian contain a revelation of God. There is no trace in them of speculation or contamination with figments of the imagination.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ibid</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re regularly imagining yourself as a king or queen, chances are you have vivid dreams that further reinforce the belief that you are special, different, or better than others. The cycle becomes self-perpetuating: vivid dreams at night beget crazier fantasies during the day, begetting even more vivid dreams that you want to believe as truth or see as prophecies. More and more of your time is spent outside of reality to the point where you essentially have a second personality that none of your relatives or friends would recognize. You may be an office worker but, according to your imagination, you are an illustrious figure who is not &#8220;understood&#8221; by the common people you interact with. In such a stage of delusion, you buy your own hype and will almost certainly be humbled in a way that will cause despair, when how you see yourself is not confirmed but what life&#8217;s mirror displays.</p>
<p>The imaginative faculty can be so damaged that some people can experience disassociated hallucinogenic states and visions while awake without the use of drugs. In other words, they dream while awake. In extreme conditions, medical treatment may be required, which often requires <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/modern-psychiatry-is-demonic">doping the patient</a> to turn down the biological activity of the brain.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Outside of sensible rehearsing for upcoming events, I don&#8217;t see any positive use of being taken hostage by my imaginative faculty at times when I should be focused on other tasks. The fact that random fantasies come to me when I&#8217;m attempting to serve God, such as while praying or attending a Liturgy, tells me that imagination is more of an <em>intrusion</em> upon my mind instead of an aid. If I want to write <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/heaven-or-hell">a short story</a>, I will sit down and direct my imagination onto the story, but more commonly it seems that my imagination is directing me into strange places and ideas. Before, I would play with fantasies and use them to help me escape the meaningless of life, but since I have found meaning in Christ, I have little use for the games that my imagination wants to play. Unfortunately, I damaged my nous to such an extent from so many years of secular life that I must now battle with this problem daily to attend to my obligations before God.</p>

											<p>I recently listened to Father John Valdez&#8217;s 10-part lecture series called <a href="https://www.sttimothy.net/index.php/2020/08/13/survival-course-for-orthodox-christians/">Survival Course for Orthodox Christians</a>, which offers a renewed take on Father Seraphim Rose&#8217;s lecture series <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-orthodox-survival-course-by-father-seraphim-rose">of the same name</a>. The talk on Eastern cults was especially helpful because Father John gave a list of signs that one has been deceived by a cult or false movement. I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that I had fallen for most of them to some degree in my secular past. Using Father John&#8217;s lecture as a starting point, I&#8217;d like to share seven of those signs with more detail.</p>
<h3>1. The rules don&#8217;t apply to the guru</h3>
<p>In all cults and false movements, Lord Jesus Christ is either discarded or used as a nominal head, but the real head is a guru who prescribes a litany of rules and commandments for his adherents to follow. The only problem is that the leader has a hard time following his own rules. The excuse of his &#8220;transcendence&#8221; will often be used to exempt him from the group&#8217;s moral teachings, since he will be &#8220;above&#8221; all rules, as if he were a god.</p>
<p>Guru Alan Watts taught a detachment from the world, viciously attacking the Western rat race, yet he was an alcoholic. Osho also taught detachment, yet he was attached to luxury European brands and sexual intercourse with his followers. Many Protestant leaders teach sexual morality, yet they all become embroiled in sex scandals. A worthy leader should follow the rules that he teaches, but that&#8217;s not what happens when a guru teaches a false gospel.</p>
<h3>2. There is no external need for God</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16045" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="471" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-1060x704.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-550x365.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-753x500.jpg 753w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-1920x1275.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-1626x1080.jpg 1626w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-yoga-india-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>In a false movement, without the guru, you&#8217;re lost. He&#8217;s not directing your soul to God but onto himself so that he gets all the rewards. Since <em>all</em> cults are sex cults in disguise, this means more fleshly rewards for him along with wealth, fame, and riches. The movement manipulates its adherents to think that they are lost without the leader. Guru co-dependency is encouraged.</p>
<p>In Eastern philosophies, a big lie is added: &#8220;You are God.&#8221; The gurus insist that you are perfect, already a literal god, and only need the guru&#8217;s guidance to unlock the divinity within you. This notion is pleasing to <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/do-you-exempt-yourself-from-gods-law">the pride of Western man</a>, who flock towards these teachings to be constantly reminded that they are of the divine and do not have to heal their fallen nature through the grace of God upon repentance.</p>
<h3>3. The promise of fast results without strenuous labor</h3>
<blockquote><p>The striving to defeat the qualities of the fallen nature inspires the monk to such asceticism that those who have never attempted it cannot even imagine. This labor, which is a rejection of one&#8217;s very nature, supplements the crucifixion and cross of poverty, which is only a rejection of money. This labor leads one to the very depth of humility, it brings one to living faith, it raises one to a state of grace. &#8212;Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov in The Field</p></blockquote>
<p>The key to hooking someone onto a false movement is quickly giving them a positive experience that shows the guru&#8217;s teachings &#8220;work&#8221; without having to expend much labor. This type of fast-food spirituality is often done with other adherents who are enraptured by the alleged bliss, peace, or pseudo-grace they are experiencing, enough for the law of social conformity to take over so that the inquirer eagerly misinterprets his feelings as empirical proof of efficacy.</p>
<p>Just meditate for 20 minutes in the way the guru says and you will feel sublime calm. Just attend the rock star church service and you will be buzzing with the Holy Spirit. Just watch all the people falling down in ecstasy before the guru&#8217;s feet and you will feel ecstasy as well if you collapse like the others. Even these kinds of paltry labor are becoming too onerous for modern man, who wants more exalted spiritual experiences with even less work. This has led to the rampant use of drugs, <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/an-orthodox-examination-of-my-foolish-psychedelic-experience">especially psychedelics</a>. Under the guru&#8217;s guidance, you will smoke a potent weed in a hot room, or take mushrooms, and you&#8217;ll feel such peace and maybe even encounter demonic creatures you are told are your pals. You are indebted to the guru for such a mystical journey and commit yourself to him.</p>
<h3>4. Guru rediscovered ancient wisdom that was &#8220;lost&#8221;</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16046" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-749x500.jpg 749w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-1920x1281.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-1618x1080.jpg 1618w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/indian-male-guru-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>The guru refuses to accept canonical teachings and instead looks for obscure sources to pour in his will and judgment. Osho wrote a book on the Gospel Of Thomas, a non-canonical Gospel, and used it to affirm his own ideas, even blaspheming that Lord Jesus Christ received his teachings from Indian mystics. Many Gnostics on YouTube accept historical speculation as fact to push their own teachings which ultimately reject Orthodox Christology. Protestants read the scripture with their fallen minds and become their own pope, claiming that the teachings of Christ were lost from the time of the Apostles until lawyers and apostate monks enflamed with sexual desire rediscovered them in the 16th Century.</p>
<p>The truth is that since the time of Christ, the truth has never been hidden or lost, because Lord Jesus Christ promised us that His Church would not fall, and through <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/what-is-orthodox-christianity">the Orthodox Church</a>, it has not.</p>
<h3>5. The familiar is used to build instant rapport</h3>
<p>In modern hip-hop music, it&#8217;s common for a producer to sample an old song and blend it with new degenerate lyrics. This is done so that you feel an instant connection with the new song even though you&#8217;ve never heard it before. False movements do the same by incorporating popular trends existing in the culture so that you quickly feel comfortable in new environs where you must begin to obey the guru. Another example is the similarity between the production values of a rock concert and megachurch. Both use advanced video and audio technology alongside programmatic laser lights. If you want to go to a free rock concert, they occur all around the United States on Sunday mornings.</p>
<blockquote><p>Millennium &#8217;73 was a three-day festival held on November 8–10, 1973 at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, United States, by the Divine Light Mission (DLM). It featured Prem Rawat, then known as Guru Maharaj Ji, a 15-year-old guru and the leader of a fast-growing new religious movement. Organizers billed the festival as the most significant event in human history which would usher in a thousand years of peace. The festival&#8217;s official schedule described the three evening addresses by Guru Maharaj Ji as the highlights of the event. <strong>Big-band music, rock bands, religious songs, choral works, a dance performance and speeches by other DLM leaders filled the program from noon to 10 pm.</strong> &#8212;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_'73">Millenium &#8217;73 event in Houston</a> featuring an Indian child who many thought was god</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to find a false movement that is traditional or critical of modern trends because that would <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-visit-an-orthodox-monastery">involve real ascesis</a> that sends the adherent to the true source of traditionalism: Orthodoxy. Instead, the guru must use secular features to hook people into quickly making the decision to become a member so that the fleecing can begin.</p>
<h3>6. There is no objective morality or truth</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16047" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yoga-class-club.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>No one has rightly sought the truth who has not encountered at the end of this search&#8212;whether to accept or reject Him&#8212;our Lord, Jesus Christ, &#8216;the Way, the Truth, and the Life.&#8217; &#8212;Father Seraphim Rose in <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/nihilists-are-spiritually-dead">Nihilism</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The main method to retain members is through the management of their feelings (i.e. emotional manipulation), but since feelings and moods change, the teachings and lessons must also change to keep the coffers filled. This method of control is incompatible with objective truth, which does not change. Since false movements are more concerned with retaining dues-paying members and sex partners, the guru will mold the program so that there is continual growth, as if it were a business.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Church, if you don&#8217;t want to believe in <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-law-of-god">one of its dogmas</a>, you are outside of the Church. The hierarchy does not soften its stand on a dogma or begin to change because you believe strongly about a lie. Your feelings have absolutely no value when it comes to Church teachings. Compare that with the &#8220;seeker sensitive&#8221; approach of some Protestant churches, whereby a prospective member&#8217;s needs are identified and catered to so that they fill the pews and open their wallet. It&#8217;s possible to be in a modern church and have everyone believe in different dogmas. The truth no longer becomes important while relativity is openly encouraged. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you believe as long as everyone is on the same &#8220;wavelength&#8221; in helping the guru achieve his self-centered mission.</p>
<h3>7. A snippet of scripture or historical text is taken completely out of proportion</h3>
<blockquote><p>Falsehood is a diabolical trait. He who has assimilated false thoughts has assimilated an attribute of the devil. He has entered into a relationship with the outcast angels; he has made union with God alien to himself and unnatural. He who is a stranger to God is a stranger to salvation. &#8212;Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov</p></blockquote>
<p>Famous Russian author <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/top-10-passages-from-leo-tolstoys-war-peace">Leo Tolstoy</a> went against the Orthodox Church and created an entire heretical movement by misinterpreting what the Bible said about peacemaking. He was eventually excommunicated from the Church but managed to cause immense damage to those who believed his lies.</p>
<p>I suspect that modern gurus are less concerned with the truth than appearing different or unique to hook wayward souls onto their movement. They are eager to provide new exegetical accounts that are absurd on their face, but since man is so far from God, born in iniquities and conceived in sin, he is prone to falling for such lies, and so new cults are continually being made.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The Holy Spirit, descended on the apostles on the day of Pentecost, according to the words of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, who promised to send Him down at the Last Supper, is primarily the Spirit of truth and was sent to the disciples of the Lord in order to instruct them on all truth (Jn 16, 13), and therefore the true Church of Christ, informing the believers of the grace of the Holy Spirit, is the one who keeps, confesses and preaches the Truth. In the same place where, instead of Truth, lies are proclaimed, whether in dogmatic doctrine or in moral or in the sense of any untruth in general, there certainly is no true Church, there is no God&#8217;s grace that saves man, but only one appearance, blasphemous deception. &#8212;<a href="https://archbishopaverky.blogspot.com/2018/03/about-mp.html">Archbishop Averky</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I fell for many of the above tricks when I believed in the Eastern lie of becoming your own God. I believed <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/16-types-of-thoughts-that-assault-me-while-praying">in my thoughts</a> and feelings and essentially did whatever I wanted to do in the name of being one with the Universe and acting as a dead fish to &#8220;go with the flow.&#8221; There was no grace and no healing to my soul. Shamefully, I even went to a couple of yoga classes while living in Europe to mimic bodily configurations that were historically used to commune with Hindu demons. Thankfully, Lord Jesus Christ has removed the scales from my eyes and allowed me to see the full truth&#8212;without adulteration and without error&#8212;through His Orthodox Church. No one converts to Orthodoxy without having sustained prior damage from false movements, so may God help them all be received into the only true movement that is God&#8217;s Church.</p>

											<p>A common lament from chaste Orthodox men I meet is their lack of experience in dealing with women who are more socialized than them. How can these men understand women, identify one with strong faith, and make confident decisions concerning marriage? As an unmarried middle-aged man, I stress to them how I&#8217;m not in a better situation, but they nonetheless feel that I can give them profitable lessons in their quest to enter an Orthodox marriage due to my excessive secular experience.</p>
<p>I have tried to be thoughtful about what I&#8217;m about to share so as not to interfere with God&#8217;s will in bringing together man and woman in one flesh within the Church sacrament of marriage, because most of my experiences with women took place sinfully outside of marriage, causing me to lose all manner of healthy child-like innocence when viewing the opposite sex. I do not consider myself bitter, but I am surely cynical from partaking in behaviors that went against the commandments of God for so many years. If you perceive undue pessimism or even anger in my words, it is due to the damage I inflicted upon myself, not because God made a mistake in how he constructed man or woman. If you participate in evil for a prolonged period of time, you will carry distorted views of reality even <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/are-you-on-the-path-to-salvation">long after repentance</a>.</p>
<p>It could be possible that a secular woman you have feelings for will possess every negative trait I&#8217;m about to describe. When a woman lacks spiritual life, she does not struggle against her passions and sins, or even think they are wrong. On the other hand, the Orthodox women I&#8217;ve met and observed possess at least a basic desire for moral goodness, and will automatically be more suitable for marriage. However, some Orthodox women are more zealous than others, and they all swim in a putrid secular fishbowl. The tainted water corrupts us without our conscious awareness, and so it&#8217;s not uncommon for an Orthodox woman to possess deep-seated secular beliefs that can strain a marriage. You must be discerning when it comes to identifying any beliefs that would be detrimental to maintaining a Christian family home.</p>
<p>I will often use the secular word &#8220;game&#8221; in this article. Game is a collection of psychological and behavioral techniques to attract a woman physically and emotionally for the purpose of fornication and fleshly pair bonding. Game includes: approaching an unknown woman in a public place while play-acting as a confident man, optimizing one&#8217;s aesthetic so that it pleases worldly woman, using salesman techniques of rapport building and scarcity to make a fast &#8220;sale,&#8221; hiding flaws while showcasing strengths, deliberately pumping up a woman&#8217;s emotions, lying, omitting the truth, putting a woman in a negative state of anxiety or dread to modulate her attractive feelings, and exploiting a woman&#8217;s human weaknesses for selfish gain.</p>
<p>In the game process, <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/game-is-for-fallen-women">God is absent</a>, and the primary goal of the man is to satisfy his selfish craving for positive female attention, worldly love, and physical pleasure. Even if you claim to desire abstinence before marriage, you can still be using game by implementing secular techniques to meet women, get their phone number, arrange dates, and so on. A sign you are <em>not</em> using game is if you adhere to the old cliché &#8220;be yourself,&#8221; where yourself is a child of God who follows His commandments with the understanding that marriage is a sacrament whose purpose is to usher two souls into heaven. The Christian way is to trust in God to pair you with a woman who is on your social and spiritual level instead of pretending to be an alpha male to deceive a woman into liking you using mostly physical and psychological means.</p>
<p>That said, here is a list of general guidance for men who want to pick the right woman for marriage in an Orthodox courtship where the man clearly expresses to the woman beforehand that no intimacy can take place until they are united in one flesh through the Church sacrament of marriage.</p>
<h3>1. Assume that you will never change her</h3>
<blockquote><p>Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies. The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain. She does him good and not evil all the days of her life. &#8212;Proverbs 31:10-12</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a fatal temptation for a man to look at a woman, especially a young one, as a <em>tabula rasa</em>, a blank slate for him to mold into his perfect, traditional wife who bakes cookies and croissants all day. Such a man sees all her flaws and thinks that, with time, he can eradicate them one by one as if using a laser beam. Or he sees her annoying personality traits and thinks that he can dampen them with a sort of punishment-reward stratagem. This is delusion. Who she is is who she is, and if she does change, it will be entirely dependent on her own will and its cooperation with God to serve the good. Any immediate change you do see in her, without much in the way of effort, should be viewed with suspicion.</p>
<p>Do you know how hard it is to change a single behavior, personality trait, or quirk? For example, I have the bad habit of taking the Lord&#8217;s name in vain by saying the word &#8220;Jeez&#8221; as an exclamation. For a couple of months, I have tried mightily to stop using this term, but I have not yet been successful. I have a bad habit of eating past 8pm. I&#8217;m grumpy in the mornings. I&#8217;m overly sensitive to noise and odors. I prefer socializing only in the evening. I have innumerable preferences that a potential wife may not like and will try to change, but chances are she will fail until I’m enlightened by God to work harder at correction not for my sake but for the sake of the marriage.</p>
<p>Through God&#8217;s grace, I&#8217;ve been able to step away from sinful behaviors, but the little things that are entrenched into my personality, and which do not pose an immediate risk to my salvation, have remained. This is also the case with women. Do not assume you will change her. Do not assume you can even get her to grow her hair an inch longer than it already is. Do not assume she will change <em>at all</em>. Of course a woman will do many things to please her man, such as to lose a few pounds or dress differently, and she may be motivated to improve for you in a way that she didn&#8217;t while single, but don’t expect immediate, permanent change.</p>
<h3>2. Women are capable of deceiving men</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16023" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/male-woman-date-skeptical-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, But she who causes shame is like rottenness in his bones.<br />
&#8212;Proverbs 12:4</p></blockquote>
<p>The more secular a woman is, the more likely she will set out to deceive a man without ever believing she is being deceptive. How this plays out is that everything will seem to be going well with her while in a romantic relationship, and then one day you are blindsided by her shocking behavior. I wrote books on women, thought I knew them better than myself, but was still badly deceived by them, because as a man, we are not given natural tools to spot every female deception under the sun. There are thousands—perhaps millions of men—who came home one day and stumbled upon a horrible discovery that changed their lives forever. In heartache, they concluded that they never really knew their significant other at all.</p>
<p>It’s possible for a woman to pretend to be someone she is not, sometimes for many years and certainly for the short amount of time needed to put forth a favorable impression and cement a man&#8217;s affections during courtship. I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes. Depending on how skilled she is, the lie may be something as minor as a political opinion she&#8217;s hiding to not displease you or as serious as living an entirely different lifestyle behind your back. The man who is lusting after a woman will not be able to see through the deception, but a chaste man whose eyes and ears are not tainted by lust should be able to see through any false façade by picking up on inconsistencies in behavior while continually self-checking whether she is &#8220;too good to be true.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the risk of getting philosophical, I believe that women themselves don’t know when they’re being deceptive or not. Their behavior is subconsciously driven to maximize the rewards received from a man with whom they want to be in a relationship. On the other hand, it is unlikely that a woman is consciously deceiving you if she is open about confessing all her flaws and problems.</p>
<h3>3. If her spirit and behavior are more secular than Orthodox, she is abiding by the secular world</h3>
<blockquote><p>Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding, But what is in the heart of fools is made known. &#8212;Proverbs 14:33</p></blockquote>
<p>A fish may strongly desire to be a healthy fish, but if it&#8217;s swimming in polluted water, many of its biological functions will be impaired. As sincerely as we wish to be Orthodox, the waters around us are dirty and foul, and though our intentions may be good, we simply cannot block out all the toxic effects that are seeping unaware into our souls. I believe that even listening to one pop song can be damaging to the soul, and yet if we don&#8217;t voluntarily listen to such music, we are subjected to it every time we <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/why-does-the-supermarket-play-pop-music">walk into a retail store</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great that a woman goes to Liturgy every Sunday and confesses her sins and receives Communion, but it is not great if for the six remaining days of the week she is glued to her smartphone, watches Netflix, attends a university, listens to rap music, reads feminist influencers online, uses TikTok, watches reality television, follows celebrity gossip, and participates in Snapchat exchanges with men. In such a case, her behavior will be more driven by secular trends than her faith, driving her away from traditional family life.</p>
<p>If I met a woman who consumed over 20 hours of secular content a week, but spent only 5 hours on her faith, yet proclaimed to me that she wants to be a traditional wife, I would think she&#8217;s confused, because it&#8217;s not traditional to be <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/why-do-you-consume-secular-content">attached to worldly content</a> streamed from her smartphone. If, however, another woman said she wants to be traditional, and shares a sentiment of hatred toward the modern world, and I can hardly get in touch with her because she leaves her smartphone off for most of the day, I can be more assured that she is sincere.</p>
<p>Since a woman&#8217;s smartphone is an extension of her personality and innermost desires, I may ask any female I&#8217;m considering if she can show me all the apps installed on her phone. If she has all the popular social media apps, and not even a single Bible or prayer app, you have an answer.</p>
<p>Just because a woman is Orthodox does not mean you must throw away all discernment and think everything will be fine. She is still a product of this corrupt world and you must keep your wits about you to see if she possesses the most important qualities needed to be a wife and mother. You must examine her flaws and ask yourself if you can endure them, and ask if your flaws can be endured by her. You don&#8217;t want a woman exclaiming &#8220;I&#8217;m Orthodox&#8221; to cause you to close your eyes and jump in without discernment.</p>
<h3>4. A woman who maintains a perfect physical appearance may crave validation from men more than God</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16024" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-model-makeup-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>And there a woman met him, with the attire of a harlot, and a crafty heart. She was loud and rebellious, her feet would not stay at home. At times she was outside, at times in the open square, lurking at every corner. &#8212;Proverbs 7:10-12</p></blockquote>
<p>It is my experience that the more time a woman invests into her external appearance, the less time she invests in the internal (her soul). This was most vividly shared with me during my long-ago stint in Ukraine, which had the most beautiful women out of all the nations I&#8217;ve visited. Part of their beauty was natural, as the beauty of Slavic women is renowned, but much of it is time spent on manual physical enhancement at the beauty salon.</p>
<p>On my dates with Ukrainian women, they revealed to me how much time they spend on their hair, nails, makeup, skin, clothing, and so on, and yet those same women could not tell me the last book they read. It turned out that I&#8212;as an impassioned foreign tourist&#8212;was selecting the most materialistic women in Ukraine who wanted to trade their beauty for an increase in adventure or living standard. Consider that these women spent a huge percentage of their low incomes simply on beauty upkeep, which in hindsight was depressing because Ukraine is an Orthodox country with God&#8217;s bottomless grace available to them if they walked around the corner of their home into a church. I enabled their materialistic behavior by giving them my attention, interest, affection, and time in the hopes of a carnal reward.</p>
<p>Be on guard for a woman who has <em>excessive</em> concern for her appearance, because that may signify that her flesh is getting more maintenance than her soul. That will be a large problem for a passionate secular man who marries her, because a woman&#8217;s vanity may only please his eyes for a short period of time.</p>
<h3>5. You will not choose a woman with wisdom if your passions are elevated</h3>
<blockquote><p>With her enticing speech she caused him to yield, with her flattering lips she seduced him. Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks, till an arrow struck his liver. As a bird hastens to the snare, he did not know it would cost his life. Proverbs 7:21-23</p></blockquote>
<p>Passions are fleeting, temporary, and capricious. Making life decisions based on your passions and emotional urges is like building a house on sand. If a passionate woman likes you, it is more likely because you please her physically and emotionally in the current moment, not because she has assessed your faith and values for the long term. Passionate secular men, of which I was one, want to be pleased in the moment. They think that every flight of fancy that enters their mind is a worthwhile pursuit that can maximize their happiness. It was my unbridled passion that allowed me to waste two decades of my life, selecting the wrong women continually for bodily pleasure, pride, and masculine ego gratification. I had built my whole life on sand and realized at a late hour what a folly that was.</p>
<p>If you meet a woman you like, and for the next few days you can&#8217;t even think straight because your mind is whirring with fantasies about how beautiful she is and how great your future life will be and how many children you will have, you are aflame with passion and emotion. Even adrenaline may be at play if you find it hard to sleep because of thoughts concerning her. This behavior is actually feminine, codified in hundreds of romance novels. We are men, not women, and must check ourselves when we enter &#8220;romance novel&#8221; mode, of which I have done innumerable times.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safer instead to make a more detached assessment that allows logic to reign so that you can build any future relationship on rock instead of sand. One sign you are proceeding correctly is if you&#8217;re patient and take your time to evaluate a woman before even speaking with her. If there is a woman in my church who I&#8217;m interested in, I will not immediately strain to talk to her. Instead, I will observe her from a distance, politely ask about her situation to married parishioners or church elders (without fishing for gossip), and then contemplate the matter for days or weeks until I can make a calm assessment of whether it&#8217;s even reasonable to have a conversation with her. On the other hand, if I see a new girl in the church and run up to her after the Liturgy with a church pickup line, I&#8217;m simply following my passions.</p>
<p>I am surprised how much pickup culture has infused into the minds of young Orthodox men, but I can tell you that such techniques are a blind alley. You must not be burning with desire when deciding to get to know a new woman.</p>
<h3>6. Beware if &#8220;game&#8221; works on her</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16025" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-date-seduction-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>The wise woman builds her house, but the foolish pulls it down with her hands. &#8212;Proverbs 14:1</p></blockquote>
<p>If game works on a woman, either she’s naive in a healthy manner, and has not been previously exposed to men who methodically trigger her fallen nature, or she is a woman who has chosen to feed her fallen nature. Think of game as an offensive joke. Even if you’re pious, the joke may get a laugh out of you, but then you quickly comport yourself and decide not to “enjoy” it further since it comes at the expense of others.</p>
<p>In the same vein, game can &#8220;work&#8221; on a pious Orthodox woman in that it can get her attention, pique her interest, and create temporary feelings of attraction, but she should have the spiritual tools to fight this common temptation. She knows that pursuing a man because of romantic or sensual feelings is not pleasing to God, and will let the temptation fade away like all other temptations she faces throughout the day. If a woman acts on the temptation by seeking a man&#8217;s attention who is obviously unsuitable (i.e. a &#8220;bad boy&#8221;) and actually wants to date him, she may not be ready to sustain a &#8220;boring&#8221; monogamous relationship with a devout Orthodox man where the household revolves around serving God instead of her emotional feelings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple matter to use some game on a Christian woman to command her attention, but it should quickly fizzle out when she comes to her senses. However, game reliably works on any woman-–Christian or not—who is individualistic, selfish, narcissistic, impious, and carnal. In fact, such a woman may<em> only</em> respond to men who use game. If a man is able to use a couple of game tricks to inflame a woman’s emotions and send her on a roller coaster ride of excitement and desire, and she makes a choice to be with that man to seek a further amplification of pleasure and &#8220;happiness,&#8221; fornication can happen in no time because it is merely a culmination of the emotional satisfaction she craves.</p>
<p>All women can have their emotions stirred by a cad, but the mature woman with an active spiritual life and pious support circle should be able to isolate those emotions, know that such a man is not good for her salvation, and move on to a more suitable match. If you see a woman who whips her head this way and that for the most attractive men with big muscles, a cocky attitude, and affected gorilla-like movements, pray for her that she can fight her passion. The same, of course, applies to you. If all it takes is a pretty face for you to forget about God then you must increase your spiritual labors. Until you gain maturity, run away from the type of woman who stirs up your passions.</p>
<h3>7. A woman who simultaneously communicates with numerous men likely has an addiction to male attention</h3>
<blockquote><p>This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, and says, &#8220;I have done no wickedness.&#8221; &#8212;Proverbs 30:20</p></blockquote>
<p>I assert that a woman who is addicted to male attention will wreck a marriage. This addiction has affected me personally and made me extremely sensitive to a woman who must continually present herself to random men and converse with male &#8220;friends.&#8221; What happens is an acquaintanceship or “friendship” turns either into something more or something inappropriate, where she seeks in those men what she should be seeking from her man alone.</p>
<p>At best, she may view the other men as friends, but at worse they are &#8220;backup plans&#8221; for the moment when you dissatisfy her by trying to uphold an Orthodox or moral standard upon the relationship. In the minds of the men who are orbiting around your woman, they may view the friendship as an investment where one day they can cash in with an instance of sin.</p>
<p>It is certainly possible that a man and woman can be friends, but it should be within a strictly Christian context. With my current female friends, we talk about God more than anything else, and if their gender happened to be male instead, the topic of our conversations would hardly change, only the tone would. All my conversations with women are structured around the fact that we are in the same Church looking to save our souls. There is no innuendo, flirting, or double entendres. If a woman you are evaluating has friendships with men that do not present like this, she is either in pre-courtship with multiple men, using them for favorable attention, or sizing up suitors as if shopping in a department store. I wouldn&#8217;t trust any platonic relationship that doesn&#8217;t have a spiritual foundation, because if the root of her problem is an addiction to male attention, that addiction doesn&#8217;t magically go away when you marry her. In that case it&#8217;s not only her you marry, but all of her male &#8220;friends” as well.</p>
<h3>8. A woman who can&#8217;t maintain small commitments may not be ready to make larger ones</h3>

<blockquote><p>For why should you, my son, be enraptured by an immoral woman, and be embraced in the arms of a seductress? &#8212;Proverbs 5:20</p></blockquote>
<p>If a woman cancels her first official meeting (date) with you, she’s setting a bad tone. As men we <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/do-you-deserve-a-good-woman">should not be entitled</a>, and adapt graciously when unexpected things happen to people, but if there’s a clear pattern of a woman not respecting your time or treating you flippantly, it could be a warning sign that she is not that interested in you or using you as a backup plan. In my experience, a woman who is genuinely interested in a man will go out of her way to uphold dates and show up on time. If she repeatedly cancels dates, is silent with communication for prolonged periods though you were expecting a response, or actively flirts with other men (even in your presence), she may be using you only for attention.</p>
<p>Think of all the steps it takes to go from meeting a woman to marrying her: all the phone calls, text messages, meetings, Bible studies, planning sessions, and so on up to the wedding date. What is a woman telling you if very early on she takes days to reply to a text message or cancels multiple meetings for the flimsiest of reasons? The earlier a woman displays flakey behavior to you, the less serious she may see you as a marital prospect.</p>
<h3>9. A woman is capable of making it crystal clear that she likes you</h3>
<blockquote><p>He who finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor from the Lord. &#8212;Proverbs 18:22</p></blockquote>
<p>The most common problem I see in men is not being able to realize that a woman is completely disinterested and has moved on from them many moons ago. They relay the story to me as if wondering if there is some type of chance remaining when she has probably cycled through several new suitors in the meanwhile. We&#8217;re not living in an age of coquetry where a woman displays her interests through a fleeting stare, incidental touch of the hand, or a written letter doused with her favorite perfume. No, we live in an age where a woman does the child equivalent of throwing little rocks at the men she likes. It&#8217;s a myth that women are &#8220;hard to read&#8221; and that we must &#8220;read between the lines&#8221; to know if they like you. Frankly, I&#8217;m shocked at how blatant even meek women can act toward men when they have an interest.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure if a woman likes you or not, simply wait a short while. Your inaction will cause her to escalate the means by which to get your attention, and only after that fails will she give up. If she doesn&#8217;t take any small steps in the first place, her interest in you is either slight or non-existent. Women want what they want, and they want it quickly with the least amount of delay, and can only tolerate playing games for so long.</p>
<p>Beware: don&#8217;t try to stir up a woman&#8217;s interest by acting aloof or pretending you are disinterested. Technically, this is game, and you will one day regret that you used negative emotions to build fleeting attraction.</p>
<h3>10. There is no excuse for an Orthodox woman to support leftist causes like feminism, climate change, and abortion</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15649" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-1024x722.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="501" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-1024x722.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-768x542.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-1536x1083.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-2048x1444.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-1060x747.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-550x388.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-709x500.jpg 709w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-1920x1354.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-1532x1080.jpg 1532w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/woman-books-gay-600x423.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, do not stray into her paths; For she has cast down many wounded, and all who were slain by her were strong men. Her house is the way to hell, descending to the chambers of death. &#8212;Proverbs 7:25-27</p></blockquote>
<p>While uncommon in <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/what-is-orthodox-christianity">the Orthodox Church</a>, I have met women of other Christian denominations who were fully on board with the leftist Satanic agenda (I remember once when a non-Chalcedonian woman told me that eating meat is bad for the environment). Such a woman may be Christian in name only, and you must understand that it&#8217;s not her faith that will predominantly determine her behavior towards men, including her approach to marriage, but the beliefs that <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/bankers-rule-the-world">the oligarchs of our times</a> implanted into her through propaganda and various psyops. It won&#8217;t be a surprise to you that many of these women respond readily to a man using game.</p>
<p>A temptation is to try to change the beliefs of such a woman, perhaps by saying to yourself, &#8220;She&#8217;s so close to the truth; if only I can get her to believe that abortion is wrong, and face tattoos are ugly, then she will be the perfect wife.&#8221; I already talked about the foolhardy endeavor of trying to change a woman. If a woman has beliefs that are not Orthodox or traditional, it may be best to leave her alone and pray that she accepts the truth on her own with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>11. Beautiful women live in a different reality</h3>
<blockquote><p>Do not fall for the beauty of a woman, and do not long for her beauty. &#8212;Ecclesiasticus 25:20</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, the more beautiful a woman is externally, and the more urban the environment she has lived in, the less work she had to do internally on her soul, personality, charity, and demeanor, because since puberty, worldly men freely gave her everything she wanted in exchange for simply being beautiful. No merit or effort was required. In these times, where it takes only one selfie on Instagram for a girl to be propelled to minor fame, a beautiful woman is put on a different life track than one who is not beautiful. The former live in a fantasy world where everyone is nice and polite, it&#8217;s so easy to get a job, it&#8217;s so easy to date, everyone holds doors open for them, Uber drivers are all supreme gentlemen, and so on. Unless they know they are being treated better for their beauty, they risk becoming detached from reality, and if she remains outside of the Church, this will cause huge problems for her future husband.</p>
<p>I’ve seen firsthand how very beautiful women who did not mature in the Church become allergic to struggle (since eager men always bailed them out from it). They may find it difficult to dive deeper into the more ascetical features of the Orthodox faith. Therefore, if you insist on marrying a beautiful woman, you will have to discern carefully so that you don&#8217;t marry someone whose best quality is her beauty. One exception is if a woman used to be very ugly or obese but is now beautiful, because she actually did live a period of struggle.</p>
<h3>12. You must examine yourself if you pass on a woman of strong faith because you seek a more beautiful woman</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14486" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/woman-flowers-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>A wife&#8217;s grace will delight her husband, and her skill will put fat on his bones. A silent wife is a gift from the Lord, and there is nothing worth as much as a disciplined soul. A modest wife is blessing upon blessing, and there is no scale adequate to weigh a self-controlled soul. Like the sun rising in the Lord&#8217;s heaven, is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house. &#8212;Ecclesiasticus 26:13-16</p></blockquote>
<p>If you turn down the opportunity to court a devout Orthodox woman because she wasn&#8217;t pretty enough, I don&#8217;t know what to say to you. Do you know how hard it is to find a woman who has strong faith? So because you are receiving less carnal pleasure, you will pass on her for a prettier girl who is less likely to have the same type of faith? Do you know that if your Orthodox marriage goes the distance, any beautiful wife will look not so beautiful in a few years due to the hands of time, and that it&#8217;s her faith that is the most important feature of deciding <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/secular-marriage-vs-christian-marriage">the course of your marriage</a>? As long as a woman is not abrasive on the eyes, and has a figure that is at least average, why covet more? I ask these questions primarily to myself.</p>
<h3>13. A woman who is overly comfortable around strange men may have had a lot of experience with men</h3>
<blockquote><p>I would rather live with a lion or a snake than with an evil wife. &#8212;Ecclesiasticus 25:15</p></blockquote>
<p>I interpret it as a warning sign if a woman talks with ease and confidence to strange adult men, especially when she is holding court with multiple men simultaneously who are all lavishing her with attention. While many women fantasize about a scenario where they are the queen of the ball, it&#8217;s another thing if she has no social heistation, nervousness, or awkwardness to be surrounded by virile men who are attracted to her.</p>
<p>Have you seen the shyness of a female child? When a strange man tries to politely talk to her, she literally runs away and hides behind her mother. For a grown woman who has not been socialized around passionate men all her life, she will feel uncomfortable when a strange man approaches her and certainly not enjoy it when men with inflamed passions are surrounding her. If she has no problems with such a scenario, we can assume that she has grown up like this and thinks it&#8217;s completely normal to talk to men who want to sleep with her. If this indicates an addiction to male attention, her future husband will surely be upset when she spends suspiciously long times talking to other men while in a visible state of delight.</p>
<h3>14. She may hide her most negative qualities, behaviors, and admissions until you have invested in her</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16027" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-secret-lying-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil &#8212;Proverbs 5:3</p></blockquote>
<p>This is more common with secular women than Orthodox. A crafty woman will embark on a deliberate program to hide things that she believes a man wouldn&#8217;t like, and go to great extents to do so, and only reveal things slowly after the man falls in love with her or has invested so much time in her that she believes he wouldn&#8217;t turn back because of sunk costs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been courting a girl for many weeks or months, and she drops a big bomb on you, it was probably planned and rehearsed, and not the first time she has done it. She wanted you to like her, you did, and she has calculated that you wouldn&#8217;t dare leave her now. Maybe you will choose to stay with her, and that&#8217;s your right, but what you have to ask is if there’s an even bigger bomb coming in the future, perhaps <em>after</em> you’ve married her.</p>
<p>I believe an honest woman should do a full disclosure of her physical and mental health conditions, her major flaws, and any <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/so-you-just-lost-your-virginity-to-a-man-and-feel-horrible">serious sins</a> that are relevant to a potential husband relatively early in the courtship. The same applies to men. A woman has a right to know that you used to be a world-famous pickup artist who wrote a dozen books on how to fornicate. The bad decisions we make in life will have consequences until we die, even if our repentance is earnest.</p>
<h3>15. A woman who constantly updates her social media profiles should be examined closely</h3>
<blockquote><p>She opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness. She watches over the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her blessed; Her husband also, and he praises her. &#8212;Proverbs 31:26-28</p></blockquote>
<p>The point of social media is to receive attention for your random thoughts, low-quality opinions, and vainglorious selfies. The problem with heavy dependence on social media for attention, which I had in the recent past, is that you rewire your brain to prioritize &#8220;electronic love&#8221;&#8212;or at least a digital substitute of love&#8212;over love from people in the flesh. A woman receiving “love” from 100 men online, who leave comments on her latest selfie, will spike her dopamine more than receiving love from one man who may only show it by quietly sitting in her presence or taking her out to Culvers for a burger. If a woman gets addicted to the neurochemical aspects of receiving favorable attention, your love will not be able to compete with the attention that hordes of men give her online.</p>
<p>A warning sign that a woman is addicted to internet attention is if she updates and curates her social media profiles as if it were a job. If she&#8217;s uploading videos or pictures multiple times a week, it&#8217;s safe to assume that she has a strong attachment that will not be immediately broken upon entering a real relationship. On the other hand, if she&#8217;s online simply because she&#8217;s lonely, you should see a rapid decrease in her usage upon easing into a relationship with you. You will have to discern if her social media is due to loneliness or due to an addiction that has to be broken through effort, lest it harms any relationship she eventually enters.</p>
<h3>16. Unless you have evidence to the contrary, she will become her mother and treat you like her mother treats her father</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16028 size-large" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-daughter-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Better to dwell in a corner of a housetop, than in a house shared with a contentious woman. &#8212;Proverbs 21:9</p></blockquote>
<p>Men and women mimic the roles they saw while growing up. If you meet a woman, you may think to yourself that she is nothing like her mother, but consider that she has yet to get married and have children. Once she gets married, assume she will treat you similarly to how her mother treats her father. Once she becomes a mother, assume she will treat the children in similar ways that her mother treated her. If you want to know how married life will be with a woman, you can start by looking at the mother&#8217;s behavior. Unless the woman you like has wholesale anathematized her mother&#8217;s conduct, it&#8217;s safe to assume that she will become similar to her mother. There is nothing wrong with this, and it also works with you becoming your father, but if you see major problems with her mother, you must investigate further.</p>
<p>For example, if you notice that her mother constantly complains to the father and tries to put him down, you may want to ask how long that has been going on. Perhaps the woman is not complaining to you right now, but that&#8217;s because she is trying to put her best foot forward in the courtship phase so that you like her. Once you get into the humdrum of marriage, she will fall back on what she knows, which she subconsciously learned from her mother.</p>
<p>I haven’t talked much about a woman’s relationship with her father, but it cannot be overstated that the healthier her relationship with her father, the healthier her relationship with her future husband. Heavy discernment must be used if she was not raised properly by her father or is not on good terms with him.</p>
<h3>17. Take signs of heightened passion, mental instability, mental illness, self-harm, and a violent or abusive upbringing very seriously</h3>
<blockquote><p>Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the Lord. &#8212;Proverbs 19:14</p></blockquote>
<p>A sign that a man may be in deception is if he says the following: &#8220;Yes it&#8217;s true that she is mentally ill and cut herself when she was a teenager, and was beaten by her alcoholic parents, and ran away from home a few times, and just got off psychotropic drugs, but she is completely fine now.&#8221; Getting over an abusive past or mental illness is not like the flu, where once you get over it you&#8217;re essentially back to full health. Instead, it presents as a continuum of symptoms that, in one way or another, stay with a person for much of their life.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/marrying-a-woman-with-mental-illness">mental health problems</a>, which are quite common, I&#8217;m sure there are success stories of women who have been able to manage their illness in a marriage, but you must not close your eyes to the problem or else you will get caught unaware when she has an episode that is triggered by the stress of marriage or child raising. Before you marry her, examine her mental health problems as if you were a doctor. Find out what triggers her episodes, how debilitating the episodes are, and then ask yourself if that&#8217;s the sort of cross you are able to endure.</p>
<p>If you are considering marrying a woman with mental illness, you should be comfortable with bedside caretaking. During a mental health episode, you will have to devote time to taking care of her until the episode passes, and that will include feeding her and watching over her so that she doesn&#8217;t hurt herself.</p>
<h3>18. Do not delude yourself into thinking that you can command a woman to do whatever you want</h3>

<blockquote><p>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. &#8212;Ephesians 5:22-27</p></blockquote>
<p>A naive man with only casual sex experience may think he&#8217;ll simply be an alpha male in the relationship and command his wife to do whatever he wishes, and that alone will preserve the marriage. One problem with that notion is that a woman has free will given by God. She has two other options in the face of your blunt commands: (1) not obey while making excuses for her disobedience, or (2) obey in such a way that she will make your life miserable.</p>
<p>There are always house tasks that a woman doesn&#8217;t like doing but does anyway, just like there are tasks at work you don&#8217;t like doing, but if she simply does not want to do what you&#8217;re asking her, and you attempt to force her through your masculine authority, you will probably regret it in due time. A wife is not a mindless slave, and if you persist in forcing her to do things, she will &#8220;pay you back&#8221; in ways that you didn&#8217;t imagine, starting with nagging and then escalating all the way to having an affair.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, you should find a wife who wants or has agreed to do the things you want a wife to do. These conversations must be had <em>before</em> you get married. If you want a wife who cooks and cleans, you must inquire if she is willing to do these things (better if she already does them) and then verify her words. However, if you marry a woman in the secular way, based more on romantic compatibility, you will neglect to test her for these values and may come to find out that she refuses to do most of what you find important. Where is that romantic compatibility now when you&#8217;re eating out more than you like, the house is a mess, and she listens to hours of brain-dead music every day? In such a case, you may have been too busy lusting over her body to know what kind of person she really was.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to test a woman for all her little values, but you can test her for meekness and the willingness to please her husband in accordance with Church teachings. It&#8217;s preferable to find a woman who doesn&#8217;t need to be persuaded or commanded to do every little thing that you believe is important.</p>
<h3>19. If she&#8217;s an adult and doesn&#8217;t yet know how to cook, bake, or sew, she may never learn it</h3>
<blockquote><p>Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and depart from evil. &#8212;Proverbs 3:7</p></blockquote>
<p>If a woman made it to 25 years of age and hasn&#8217;t yet learned the household skills that are critical to maintaining a Christian household, don&#8217;t assume that she will learn it and be good at it. That works the other way around, too. If a woman wants a husband who is good at home maintenance, but her current prospect can barely use a screwdriver, it would be unwise of her to think he will learn that skill just because he says he will. The reality is that both men and women will say almost anything to have their affections returned.</p>
<p>The proof is in the pudding. If a man is looking for a wife, and he is not currently learning the things he says he will do in a marriage, his wish may be aspirational. If a woman is looking for a husband and knows that she will have to cook daily in a family home, but is not currently doing it, there is a disconnect that must be evaluated. The only exception that could be valid is if the activity is dependent on having a certain kind of home. For example, I want to learn how to work with wood, but I can&#8217;t do it while living in an apartment. I also want to learn how to garden, but I can&#8217;t because I have no land and only north-facing (low-light) windows. However, I do maintain a few plants, so a woman who hears me say I want to garden can see that I have started that endeavor. She can conclude that it&#8217;s <em>possible</em> I will someday garden. When it comes to woodworking, however, she will not find any evidence of that skill, so she should not assume I will ever woodwork.</p>
<p>Personally, I am extremely skeptical of a woman who says she will learn how to cook but hasn&#8217;t turned on her stove in months. The reason is that she has 2-3 opportunities <em>every day</em> to do what she says she will do but is not doing! What&#8217;s stopping her now? If she lives in a home with a kitchen, nothing. If I encounter such a woman, and know that she eats takeout every day, I will have to assume she will never cook, and account for that in my decision to marry her or not. The same goes for other skills that are important to me, like sewing (buttons do fall off), laundry, ironing, and being organized in general. I must see these qualities now or at least hints of them, because talk is cheap, and we need more than talk to have a successful family home.</p>
<h3>20. If she has a career, don&#8217;t assume she will quit when you want her to</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16030" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-1024x684.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-1060x708.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-749x500.jpg 749w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-1920x1282.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-1617x1080.jpg 1617w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/woman-office-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Do not give water an outlet, nor boldness to an evil wife. If she does not follow your good leadership, cut her off from yourself. &#8212;Ecclesiasticus 25:24-25</p></blockquote>
<p>Chances are that you will find a woman who has a full-time job. Either that job is a waystation to a family, and she will quit when the children start arriving, or she will want to hold onto that job for as long as possible because it validates how she sees herself (independent, strong, high-achieving, etc.).</p>
<p>If you meet a woman who tells you that she desires to be a stay-at-home mother, and that her job isn&#8217;t necessary for her, but she will work at it for as long as needed, it may be safe to assume that she will eventually quit. However, if a woman hints that her career is important to her because it gives her a sense of &#8220;purpose,&#8221; or she likes making money, it is not safe to assume she will quit, even if she does not react vehemently to your wish for her to be a stay-at-home wife. Generally, the more feminist she is, the less likely she will quit when you want, for she may have succumbed to the lie that a career is the most important part of a woman&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>Failure to discern in this matter could be catastrophic: the children are sent to daycare, they will not be homeschooled, the household duties do not get done, she never learns how to cook (since it’s time-consuming), she is in obedience to a boss at work which effectively means she has two men in her life, and she is frequently fatigued and irritated. She may even try to push you into the role of stay-at-home dad so that she can have her cake and eat it too. I&#8217;m fearful enough of accidentally marrying a feminist that I must be convinced of a woman&#8217;s insatiable desire to be a traditional stay-at-home mother before entering a courtship with her.</p>
<h3>21. She will lose respect and attraction for you if you become emasculated and allow her to take control</h3>
<blockquote><p>But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. &#8212;1 Corinthians 11:3</p></blockquote>
<p>A common failure of men is backsliding on their masculinity and leadership. It is true that a woman will constantly test her man for strength, usually by nagging him to have more say in decision-making, but if that request is actually granted, she loses respect for him, because he becomes less of a &#8220;him&#8221; and more of a &#8220;her.&#8221; We don&#8217;t really know why women petition men for things that ultimately make them unhappy, but it is a test we must pass by maintaining our leadership position in the household.</p>
<p>If we fall for the trap of &#8220;equality&#8221; that is so common in secular relationships, the woman will start to lose respect for her man and so begins the typical side effects of her withholding sex, going out more often with her friends, maintaining inappropriate relationships with men online, neglecting household duties, starting a new gym routine with a young male trainer, and so on. It&#8217;s hard to relay to men the severity of this trap when it starts in such a banal manner, that obeying a woman who really believes she must choose where to go out for dinner, for example, will actually begin a process where the husband is feminized, weakened, and destroyed in divorce. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen this personally in your life as I have. Maintain your masculine frame or else she will take up that mantle and despise you for it.</p>
<h3>22. No matter how thoroughly you vet her, you will be upset at her behaviors during marriage</h3>

<blockquote><p>And Adam said, this [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. &#8212;Genesis 2:23-24</p></blockquote>
<p>Human behavior tends to be domain specific. My daily habits and routine when I was living in a European city is different from when living in an American suburb. The foods I eat, the times I shower, and how much I read are all different depending on the domain I find myself in. In one domain, a woman acts this way, but in another domain, she acts differently. How a woman behaves when she&#8217;s single or in courtship is not going to be identical to her behavior as a wife or mother. A woman may appear perfect to you in the courtship phase, but after marrying her and living with her, you will see her flaws that may even make you feel regretful. This doesn&#8217;t mean you made the wrong choice, or that she deceived you, but that wifely behaviors had no outlet for display within a stress-free courtship.</p>
<p>The point of marriage is not to eliminate the potential for failure or hardship. I&#8217;m tempted to make sure a potential wife doesn&#8217;t have any major problems that may cause me pain in the future, but this is not the Orthodox Christian way. We are not gods who can see the future, and we are called upon to have faith in Lord Jesus Christ to pair us with a suitable spouse, not our own ability to avoid worldly pain. When you marry a woman, and she displays an odd behavior that displeases you, do not think, &#8220;What have I done to marry this woman? My life is ruined!&#8221; Instead think, &#8220;My Lord commands me to pick up and carry my Cross. Now I must bear and endure that which my wife is doing, as she is flesh of my flesh, and she must endure my innumerable flaws. So be it, so be it.&#8221;</p>
<h3>23. If she doesn&#8217;t like to be corrected, signifying a strong will, you will have many disagreements</h3>
<blockquote><p>Better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and angry woman. &#8212;Proverbs 21:19</p></blockquote>
<p>People who don&#8217;t like being corrected, like myself, often have elevated pride. It&#8217;s impossible for their ego to handle someone telling them that they are doing something wrong and that they must change their thinking or behavior. If you attempt to correct a woman, the most common response will be that she starts crying. If she&#8217;s more of a combative type, you may hear, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do it yourself then?&#8221; Even if you are exceedingly gentle, her pride will perceive the correction in the worst possible way and be wounded by it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had experiences with women who simply could not take loving correction, and let me tell you: it&#8217;s a total drag. Their pride is preventing them from doing simple things that you like. For example, once a secular girlfriend was preparing lunch for me. I politely asked her to cut my apple in a way that I preferred. She got angry and made a big stink about it. It&#8217;s no surprise that the relationship later ended in a bitter way. I can&#8217;t imagine how life would have been with her if I tried to correct her on matters bigger than how an apple is cut.</p>
<p>During your courtship with a woman, it may be useful to correct her on something that is genuinely bothering you. The best response is if she accepts and does it the correct way. If she gets upset and sheds tears, but still performs the correction, that may not necessarily be a bad sign. However, if she responds with a nasty attitude, is resistant to change, and even starts hitting you, you have to understand that this behavior will carry through in a marriage. Ask yourself if you can deal with it.</p>
<h3>24. She may lie to you but not think it is a lie, because she believes the lie to be the truth</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14808" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="533" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-1060x795.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-550x413.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-667x500.jpg 667w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-1440x1080.jpg 1440w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/woman-eye-dark.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>The mouth of an immoral woman is a deep pit; He who is abhorred by the Lord will fall there. &#8212;Proverbs 22:14</p></blockquote>
<p>As the psalm says, &#8220;Every man is a liar.&#8221; The lying of women is unique compared to men because, in my opinion, much of the time they don&#8217;t really believe they are lying. The most prime example is when she states that a man she knows is &#8220;just a friend.&#8221; The reality is he is a suitor, biding his time for the best moment to attempt intercourse. In order for the woman to say the suitor is a friend, she had to view the interaction with him through a particularly narrow lens. Because there has been no physical intimacy, she thinks they are &#8220;friends,&#8221; but she ignores the emotional and romantic bond the man has for her. If she were to admit that he&#8217;s more than a friend, she would also have to admit that she&#8217;s enabling or encouraging a man who has romantic affection for her, and also admit that their relationship is only one text message away from physical intimacy. She is telling the truth only through the deliberate omission of numerous relevant facts.</p>
<p>Another example is when a woman says, &#8220;I have had three boyfriends,&#8221; and then gives you ample details on those three boyfriends without mentioning any others, as if she has never met any other man in her life. She frames the discussion in such a way that a man will want to conclude that she has only had intercourse with three men, but it&#8217;s quite possible she has been intimate with many more. Here she is lying by omission to a man who wants to believe the lie.</p>
<p>If you ask personal questions that hit upon her mistakes or flaws, and her faith is small, prepare for lies that she may not think of as lies. If you try to confront a woman on a lie, as I have often done, you should not be surprised if she refuses to admit fault and then blames you for not trusting her. The main persuasive weapon a woman uses against man, tears, will then make their appearance.</p>
<h3>25. It&#8217;s common for a woman to conform to a man&#8217;s interests and hobbies to receive his affection</h3>
<blockquote><p>A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment, for all who do so are an abomination to the Lord your God. &#8212;Deuteronomy 22:5</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when it began that men started to desire women who shared the same masculine hobbies as them. &#8220;She loves watching sports, drinking beer, and shooting guns&#8230; I&#8217;m in love!&#8221; It must be a sign of the times when <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/seduction-is-narcissism">narcissism is so high</a> that men look to women to be just like them instead of understanding that God created two sexes with a distinct division of gifts for maintaining a family home.</p>
<p>When men signal they like a woman with masculine hobbies, women will soon come to &#8220;love&#8221; masculine hobbies. There are millions of women in the United States who know more than me about pro football, craft beer, bodybuilding, shooting guns, comic book movies, and all the most appropriate times to use profanity in conversation. They may not admit it to you, but I believe they do these things to maximize their chances of receiving affection from men and to sustain that affection by being able to talk about the things that men like.</p>
<p>The problem for you is that a woman may effortlessly pretend to like what you like if she happens to have a strong interest in you, leading you to have the wrong idea about your compatibility. If you like reading books, she will express her interest in reading books. If you like baking, she will send you a picture of her baking (for the first time ever). If you love dogs, she will love dogs and send you pictures (even though she really loves cats). Whatever you like, she will like.</p>
<p>Even more dangerous is if you&#8217;re an Orthodox Christian. She may also claim to love Orthodoxy, and even convert to the faith for you, but will love you more than the faith, at least initially. Now there are many success stories of a man bringing his wife into the Church, and many of these women come to be light-bearers of the faith, but you must use discernment to confirm she&#8217;s converting because she believes Orthodoxy is the truth, and that it&#8217;s God&#8217;s Church, not that she sees you as an ideal man and doesn&#8217;t mind a lukewarm religious commitment of only going to church for two hours on Sunday.</p>
<p>None of us can look into a woman&#8217;s soul and know why she really is converting, but there is one question you can ask her: &#8220;If our relationship were to suddenly end, would you still convert to the Orthodox faith?&#8221; If the answer is no then she is converting for you alone. Proceed with caution.</p>
<h3>26. If she&#8217;s had sexual experiences in the past, look for undeniable repentance</h3>

<blockquote><p>Any evil is small compared to the evil of a wife. May the portion of a sinner fall upon her! &#8212;Ecclesiasticus 25:18</p></blockquote>
<p>Many secular men insist on knowing how many past partners their girlfriend has had. This is what I did in my secular relationships. As an Orthodox Christian, however, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s useful to ask this because of how our soul is reformed through repentance, a turning away from sin, a regeneration of the old man into the new. With grace, you quite literally become a new person, and can no longer recognize the old person you once were. There is a gulf that exists between the man I am today and the man I was in the past, and if a woman were to solely evaluate me by what I did a few years ago, she would not be getting a complete picture of the good fruits I&#8217;m capable of producing today.</p>
<p>However, if I stopped fornicating because I merely got bored, physically tired, or hormonally depleted, and did not repent nor struggle mightily against my lust, it&#8217;s safe to assume that I&#8217;m still dominated by sin and evil. The dark fleshly passions would still be lurking underneath in full strength. Without repentance, what I did in my most recent past would then be highly indicative of what I will do in the near future, or at least am capable of doing.</p>
<p>If you identify a woman who has fallen but whose repentance is genuine (i.e. she has taken steps away from carnal living and is pursuing a pious Orthodox life) then I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll gain useful information by asking her the gory details of her sexual past. Instead, you may only need a rough sketch of her past sins to know if she is successfully attempting an earnest struggle against them in the present.</p>
<p>I pray that my past fornication was a temporary aberration, but even if it was, there are other permanent features of my personality that a potential spouse will have to deal with. It may be useful to examine qualities of a potential wife that are ongoing or have a permanent quality in the body, such as her health problems, demeanor, attitude, personality, latent addictions, and so on, instead of sins that seemed to have ended. It&#8217;s possible that by focusing on her sexual past alone that you may be ignoring something even more disruptive to a potential marital union.</p>
<p>It is your right to exclude a woman whose sexual past is too much for you to bear. I will only add that the more you fell in a certain area, the more you should accept a woman who fell like you. If you&#8217;re a virgin, perhaps you should wait for a virgin, but if you&#8217;re like me and had sexual experiences before repenting, then a woman who repented from a similar passion could be a suitable match.</p>
<h3>27. You don&#8217;t fully know a woman unless you&#8217;ve seen her angry</h3>
<blockquote><p>A continual dripping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike; Whoever restrains her restrains the wind, and grasps oil with his right hand. &#8212;Proverbs 27:16-16</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a great thing that the woman you&#8217;re courting seems to always be pleasant, kind, and meek, but she is a human being, existing in fallen flesh, and it&#8217;s just a matter of time until she gets angry. It would be helpful for you to know what she&#8217;s like when she&#8217;s angry so that you can discern if that type of anger is manageable.</p>
<p>Some women withdraw when they get angry and give you the silent treatment. Other women explode, throwing household objects and using bad language. Other women pout and cry as if having a childish temper tantrum. I&#8217;ve seen all types of anger, and none are easy to work with, but I would hesitate with any woman whose anger is deranged and violent, where she temporarily loses sanity and takes on a rage that approaches murderous (I&#8217;ve known men who were physically attacked by their girlfriends, including the case of a knife attack). With such women, warning signs will be present before you face her anger head-on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not advising you to purposefully get a woman angry in the courtship phase, because that would be manipulation, but don&#8217;t fear it. As long as you are not deceived that she is immune to experiencing anger, you want to be mentally prepared for when it happens.</p>
<p>While a woman&#8217;s anger is dangerous, a man&#8217;s is worse, because we have testosterone, which allows us to kill a woman with our bare hands. It&#8217;s far more important for a woman to understand the type of anger you have than the other way around.</p>
<h3>28. Be extremely suspicious of a woman who still communicates with past boyfriends</h3>

<blockquote><p>My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. For a harlot is a deep pit, and a seductress is a narrow well. She also lies in wait as for a victim, and increases the unfaithful among men. &#8212;Proverbs 23:26-28</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s bad enough if a woman communicates with men online she claims are her friends, but it&#8217;s a <em>serious red flag</em> if she maintains a regular dialogue with someone with whom she had a romantic relationship. This is leaving wide open the door to sexual temptation and, in the case of marriage, infidelity. I believe women maintain such relationships because it makes them feel validated and proud that a man who had access to her heart and body still &#8220;cares&#8221; about her and wants her in his life. Even worse, it could be that she is considering him as a backup plan to return to in case her next relationship fails. You can completely discard her reasoning that she is only &#8220;friends&#8221; with the ex. It is not friendship if romantic emotions or bodily fluids were exchanged (starting with kissing).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stress how this scenario is a <em>serious red flag</em> that may come to destroy any relationship you attempt to build. Any woman I court must cut off all communication (including text messaging) with exes or I will walk away with no regret. If a woman raises a stink about it, but eventually complies, I would still proceed with extreme caution, and verify that communication was indeed cut off. If a woman is not ready to throw away the attention of men she had sinful relations with for the sake of the man she may marry, is she taking the ideal of Christian marriage seriously?</p>
<h3>29. Don&#8217;t confuse her physical and emotional attraction towards you for deep compatibility</h3>
<blockquote><p>Do not let your adornment be merely outward&#8212;arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel&#8212;rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror. &#8212;1 Peter 3:3-6</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;re in danger if an attractive woman likes you, because your fallen nature is prone to entering a hypnotized state where you fixate on all the emotional pleasure she is giving you in the moment and the physical pleasure she may give you in the future. It can happen that a man is lukewarm about a woman, but then she accidentally touches him with her breast, wears a low-cut shirt, and smiles at him with extra-glossy lips that he then suddenly thinks she&#8217;s a perfect match.</p>
<p>Do you understand how easy it is for a woman of even average looks to ensnare a man if she is aided by Satan? All she has to do is wear makeup, put on perfume, wear a revealing outfit, bite her lip during key moments of the conversation, breathe slowly and deeply, and give you the green light for physical touching. Unless you are aware of what she&#8217;s doing, you will think there is a &#8220;natural&#8221; connection and in your blindness begin to see her as a woman ready for Christian marriage. Understand that in this world men have practically no resistance to a pretty woman who likes them. Most men do not even know that this is a temptation, and instead think they&#8217;ve received some kind of good luck or blessing when women look upon them as if they were a piece of meat.</p>
<p>When a woman is attracted to you, your mind begins the process of forgetting or rationalizing all her weaknesses while inventing strengths where none exist. She&#8217;s no longer impulsive&#8212;she&#8217;s spontaneous. She&#8217;s not addicted to the mindless secular culture&#8212;she&#8217;s avant-garde. She&#8217;s not filled with passions&#8212;she has a big heart. She&#8217;s not lazy with church attendance&#8212;she lives so far away and it&#8217;s hard for her pretty self to drive forty minutes each way. With attraction, any piece of coal can be instantly rubbed into a diamond.</p>
<p>You may think this sounds amusing, but the process is real and has caused men to marry women who later ruined their lives and made them consider suicide. If you readily get physically aroused in a woman&#8217;s presence or if you fantasize about being with her sexually then you are no different than a secular man lusting after a woman in a bar. The process is the same. It&#8217;s okay to be attracted to a woman, but if you&#8217;re <em>feeling</em> more than spiritually <em>discerning</em>, you may be setting up yourself for a hard fall.</p>
<p>I know myself and my inability to resist a pretty woman who likes me, so when I want to discern if a woman is right for me, I prefer to do it from afar before sustaining a relationship. I do not dive into any relations with an attractive woman because, without a plan to get to know her, I will fall into a trap of seduction because of the natural power of a woman&#8217;s beauty, allure, and femininity.</p>
<h3>30. Evaluate her for the potential to become a great mother</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16033" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="474" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-1060x707.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mother-child-woman-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>But Ruth said: &#8220;Entreat me not to leave you, Or to turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God. Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.&#8221; &#8212;Ruth 1:16-17</p></blockquote>
<p>A married man told me that the most important quality of a potential wife is if she will be a good mother. During a courtship, however, we are instead concerned about ourselves. How will she make <em>me</em> feel? How will she be a wife to <em>me</em>? How will she satisfy <em>me</em>? How will she please <em>me</em>? Me me me! Our entire standard, and much of what I&#8217;ve written above, concerns the relationship between future man and wife, but children do happen.</p>
<p>You will love your children with all your heart, but if your wife is a less-than-ideal mother, conflict and pain will enter your life as you try to correct her mistakes and deficiencies. Does it matter if your wife pleases you if you know your children are getting an upbringing that is hurting them? You will no longer perceive the prior-held romantic happiness. While you&#8217;re evaluating a woman on how well she will please you, try to also discern how she would be as a mother.</p>
<p>There are two major clues to knowing how good of a mother she&#8217;ll be. First, how does her mother treat her? Unless you have evidence to the contrary, she will be very similar to her mother. If her mother was neglectful or abusive, there is a chance the same traits may appear in her. Second, how does she act around children? If you meet her in a parish, it will be very easy to see how she interacts with kids. Personally, I want to see that a woman is patient, sensitive, and loving. I don&#8217;t buy the excuse that it&#8217;s okay for a woman to be cold to children that are not her own. If you love children, you love all children. I love pugs, and will give affection to all pugs that are not my own. I can&#8217;t fathom how I would only love my pug but not care about other pugs.</p>
<p>If a woman had a difficult childhood, hopefully she has a mentor in the Church, perhaps her godmother, who she eagerly learns from. If a woman doesn&#8217;t have the motherly ability you seek, but you&#8217;ve noticed she&#8217;s willing to be corrected, perhaps you can proceed, but if she&#8217;s not willing to be corrected at all, you will have a hard time. A lot of flaws in a woman can be somewhat discarded if she’s meek and readily obeys you. Otherwise, even the smallest flaw can become a threat to the relationship.</p>
<h3>31. An examination of her living quarters can reveal gaps in what she tells you</h3>
<blockquote><p>Say to wisdom, &#8220;You are my sister,&#8221; and call understanding your nearest kin, that they may keep you from the immoral woman, from the seductress who flatters with her words. &#8212;Proverbs 7:4-5</p></blockquote>
<p>We have to be able to trust our future wife, but until we have that trust, we must verify. A visit to her home <em>with at least one mature chaperone</em> can be a good check on the things she has been telling you about herself. If she says she&#8217;s spiritual, but you notice more K-pop posters on her walls than holy icons, you may want to dig deeper. She exclaimed to you how badly she wants to be a housewife, but is her room a pigsty? She claims she wants to cook every day for her husband, but is her refrigerator filled with only expired jars of Whole Foods branded condiments? Is the one cookbook she owns covered with cobwebs? It&#8217;s possible that many things she told you were aspirational, a work in progress, but you should begin to see movements toward the wife she yearns to be.</p>
<p>Do not go to her house alone! We do not want a check of her living quarters to lead to temptation. Family members or sober-minded friends should also be present. You may think this precaution is silly, but the second you enter her home alone, a legion of demons is behind you to tempt you both so that you desecrate your courtship. If you are underestimating Satan and think what I&#8217;m sharing is absurd, it is possible you are already in a state of falling.</p>
<h3>32. If a woman complains a lot about other people, she will soon complain about you</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10691" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/angry-woman-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="399" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/angry-woman-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/angry-woman-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/angry-woman-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/angry-woman.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door. &#8212;James 5:9</p></blockquote>
<p>Complainers are equal-opportunity, meaning that they complain about everyone. I once knew a man who would complain to me about everyone we knew, and yet he would never complain about me. It didn&#8217;t take much time for me to be grouped into his complaints. Complainers may shift their targets, but they will always land on those who are closest to them. If you find a woman who is prone to complaining, the intensity of her complaints will be entirely focused on you after you get married.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sensitive to complaints because I have relatives who are complainers. I see firsthand how <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-psychology-of-complaining">complaining can strain relationships</a> and simply make you not want to spend time with the person. A priestmonk in the Orthodox Church told me that complaining is a form of irritation, which in turn is a form of anger. Therefore, the root of complaining is anger, even if the complaints may be just or uttered in a light-hearted manner. Identify if the woman complains once in a while or if she complains all the time. If she&#8217;s an aggressive complainer, she has not found a way to tackle her anger in a way that will not damage her relationships, and you must keep a close eye on her pattern of complaining, assuming that one day the target of her complaining will be you.</p>
<h3>33. Trust in God to find a wife, not in your own abilities</h3>
<blockquote><p>The wise shall inherit glory, but shame shall be the legacy of fools. &#8212;Proverbs 3:35</p></blockquote>
<p>You can follow every piece of advice in this article, and be completely sure of any choice you make, but still fail if you don’t ask God through intense prayer for His will to be done. Be wary of only trusting yourself and what you can perceive with your senses when it comes to choosing a wife, because God can see things that you can&#8217;t see. He knows any woman more than you know her. If you&#8217;re relying more on worldly wisdom than God—and most of what I’m offering here is worldly wisdom—how can you possibly make a good choice? My suggestions are to get your foot in the door if you are inexperienced and chaste so that you are not easily manipulated, but more important than what I say is to pray daily and humbly to help evaluate any woman you are interested in. Pray to the Saints, seek out elders in the Church, and ask balanced Christians close to you for aid.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14122" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="533" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-1060x795.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-550x413.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-667x500.jpg 667w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-1440x1080.jpg 1440w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/man-male-woman-beach-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many men will read this article and say to themselves that they will avoid the big mistakes, but then something happens: they become attracted to a woman. Once the attraction happens, which is an emotional and physical process involving our flesh, rationality is first to go out the window. I hate to admit this but I&#8217;m certainly more experienced than you when it comes to falling under the spell of a woman and letting my flesh take over the driver&#8217;s seat. You think that it won&#8217;t happen to you, that you have the knowledge, but if that&#8217;s what you believe, it will surely happen to you, because you are underestimating the power of your fallen nature.</p>
<p>Even though I have experience, I do not trust my judgment in the presence of an attractive woman, because even after returning to Christ, it happened that I entered a hypnotic spell of improper judgment. Thankfully, with the help of the Church and my faith, I pulled my soul out of the spell, but I don&#8217;t kid myself: I&#8217;m one chance meeting away from self-willingly entering a state of passionate delusion. Whatever the case may be, understand that <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/only-god-can-find-you-a-good-wife">it is God&#8217;s will that must be done</a>. He allows us to fall for our benefit and He will permit us to enter a happy or unhappy marriage for our salvation. As long as He is in your heart more than any woman, accept whatever outcome arrives, love your wife in spite of all her flaws, and give thanks to God without ceasing for whatever situation you find yourself in, whether single or married.</p>

Father Seraphim reviews the teachings of saints to explain modern phenomena such as near-death experiences of those who have been revived after clinical death and also out-of-body experiences among psychedelic drug users. His book is critical reading for serious Christians, because if one were to subscribe to errant beliefs about death, and come to think that &#8220;everybody goes to heaven&#8221; or that &#8220;heaven is a state of mind, not a place,&#8221; it will start to negatively affect their spiritual life and may ultimately lead to eternal condemnation.</p>
<h4>What is death?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov: &#8220;By the fall both the soul and body of man were changed. In the strict sense the fall was for them also a death. That which we see and call death is in essence only the separation of the soul from the body, both of which had already before this been put to death by an eternal death!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>Do you believe in a spiritual reality?</h4>
<blockquote><p>We who live on earth can hardly even begin to understand the reality of the spiritual world until we ourselves come to dwell in it. This is a process that begins now, in this life, but ends only in eternity, when we will behold &#8220;face to face&#8221; what we now see only &#8220;through a glass, darkly&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:12).</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don&#8217;t believe in a spiritual reality then everything you do will be structured around pleasing your body and flesh until you die, and then when you die, none of that body-pleasing will be useful when you are fully aware and present in soul to be judged by God.</p>
<h4>What can we learn from near-death experiences among heterodox and non-Christians?</h4>
<blockquote><p>…Dr. Kubler-Ross mentions one remarkable case where a blind person &#8220;saw&#8221; and later described everything clearly in the room where she &#8220;died,&#8221; although when she came back to life she was once again blind&#8212;a striking evidence that it is not the eye that sees (not the brain that thinks, for the mental faculties become quicker after death), but rather the <em>soul</em> that performs these actions <em>through</em> the physical organs as long as the body is alive, but <em>by its own power</em> when the body is dead.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It is characteristic of our times of unbelief that these people seldom use the Christian vocabulary or realize that it is their <em>soul</em> that has been set free from the body and now experiences everything; they are usually simply puzzled at the new state they find themselves in.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>…most, perhaps indeed all, of [near-death] experiences have little in common with the Christian vision of heaven. These visions are not spiritual, but <em>worldly</em>. They are so quick, so easily attained, so common, so earthly in their imagery, that there can be no serious comparison of them with the true Christian visions of heaven in the past… Even the most &#8220;spiritual&#8221; thing about some of them&#8212;the feeling of the &#8220;presence&#8221; of Christ&#8212;persuades one more of the spiritual immaturity of those who experience it than of anything else. Rather than producing the profound awe, fear of God, and repentance which the authentic experience of God&#8217;s presence has evoked in Christians saints (of which St. Paul&#8217;s experience on the road to Damascus may be taken as a model&#8212;Acts 9:3-9), the present-day experiences produce something much more akin to the &#8220;comfort&#8221; and &#8220;peace&#8221; of the modern spiritistic and Pentecostal movements.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>…[near-death experiences] may be said to &#8220;prove&#8221; no more than a minimum doctrine of the bare survival of the human soul outside the body, and of the bare existence of a non-material reality, while giving decisively no information on non-material reality, while giving decisively no information on the further state of even existence of the soul after the first few minutes of &#8220;death,&#8221; nor of the ultimate nature of the non-material realm.</p></blockquote>
<h4>What does it mean to see dead relatives?</h4>
<blockquote><p>St. Gregory the Great, in describing many of these experiences in Dialogues, explains the phenomenon of meeting others: &#8220;It frequently happens that a soul on the point of death recognizes those with whom it is to share the same eternal dwelling for equal blame or reward&#8221; (Dialogues, IV, 36). And specifically with regard to those who have led a righteous life, St. Gregory notes that &#8220;if often happens that the saints of heaven appear to the righteous at the hour of death in order to reassure them. And, with the vision of the heavenly company before their minds, they die without experiencing any fear of agony&#8221; (Dialogues, IV, 12).</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>These encounters, while they do not seem by any means to occur to everyone before death, still can be called universal in the sense that they occur without regard to nationalist, religion, or holiness of life.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>…it must be that the dead relatives who are seen as not actually &#8220;present&#8221; as the dying believe them to be. St. Gregory the Great says only that the dying man &#8220;recognizes&#8221; people, whereas to the righteous &#8220;the saints of heaven appear&#8221;&#8212;a distinction which not merely indicates the different experience of the righteous and ordinary sinners when they die, but also is directly bound up with the different afterlife state of the saints and ordinary sinners. The saints have great freedom to intercede for the living and to come to their aid, whereas deceased sinners, save in very special cases, have no contact with the living.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>…we need not doubt that the saints actually appear to the righteous at death, as is described in many Lives of Saints. To ordinary sinners, on the other hand, there are often apparitions of relatives, friends, or &#8220;gods&#8221; which correspond to what the dying either expect or are prepared to see. The exact nature of these latter apparitions it is probably impossible to define; they are certainly not mere hallucinations, but seem to be a part of the natural experience of death, a sign to the dying person (as it were) that he is about to enter a new realm where the laws of ordinary material reality no longer hold. There is nothing very extraordinary about this experience, which seems to hold constant for different times, places, and religions.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Applying discernment to near-death experiences</h4>
<blockquote><p>…we must clearly distinguish between genuine, grace-given visions of the other world, and a merely natural experience which, even though it may be outside the normal limits of human experience, is not in the least spiritual and tells us nothing about the actual reality of either the heaven or the hell of authentic Christian teaching.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>One who is aware of this Orthodox teaching cannot but look in amazement and horror at the ease with which contemporary &#8220;Christians&#8221; trust the visions and apparitions which are now becoming so common. The reason for this credulity is clear: Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, cut off for centuries now from the Orthodox doctrine and practice of spiritual life, have lost all capability for clear discernment in the realm of spirits.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Those who are seeing &#8220;paradise&#8221; in the aerial realm today are &#8220;pleased,&#8221; &#8220;happy,&#8221; &#8220;satisfied&#8221;&#8212;seldom anything more; if they behold &#8220;Christ&#8221; in some form, it is only to indulge in the familiar &#8220;dialogues&#8221; with him that characterize experiences in the &#8220;charismatic&#8221; movement. The element of the Divine and of man&#8217;s awe before it, the fear of God, are absent in such experiences.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Demons will tempt you at the time of death and even right after</h4>
<blockquote><p>The Orthodox Lives of Saints have numerous accounts of… demonic spectacles which appear at the moment of death, usually with the aim of frightening the dying person and making him despair over his salvation.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The hour of death, then, is indeed a time of demonic temptation, and the &#8220;spiritual experiences&#8221; which people have at this time… are to be subjected to the same standard of Christian teaching as are any other &#8220;spiritual experiences.&#8221; Likewise, the &#8220;spirits&#8221; who may be encountered at this time are to be subjected to the universal test which the Apostle John expresses in the words: Test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world (1 John 4:1).</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It befits us, therefore, to be very suspicious (at the least) of the &#8220;beings of light&#8221; who seem to appear in the moment of death. They seem very much like demons posing as &#8220;angels of light&#8221; in order to seduce, not only the dying person himself, but even more those to whom he will later tell this tale if he is resuscitated (concerning the chances of which, of course, the demons are well aware).</p></blockquote>
<p>The demons are not ignorant that people who are clinically dead may be revived, so it is profitable for them to give people a &#8220;peaceful&#8221; and &#8220;calm&#8221; vision so that, in the case they do come back to life, they will ecstatically share this vision to all, reinforcing the desired notion that everybody goes to heaven and <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-field-of-spiritual-warfare">spiritual labors</a> are not necessary.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t despair if you&#8217;re swarmed by imp-looking demons surrounding your deathbed. You may think that your judgment has arrived, but really it could be a final temptation by Satan for you to forsake God.</p>
<h4>Demons provide a vision at death that corresponds to an individual&#8217;s beliefs</h4>
<blockquote><p>It is not necessary for us to define precisely the nature of the apparitions of the dying in order to see that they depend to some extent, as we have already seen on what the dying person <em>expects</em> or is <em>prepared</em> to see. Thus, Christians of past centuries who had a lively belief in hell, and whose conscience accused them in the end, often saw demons at death; Indians of today, who are certainly more &#8220;primitive&#8221; than Americans in their beliefs and understanding, often see beings that correspond to their still very real fears about the afterlife; while contemporary Americans, with their &#8220;enlightened&#8221; views, see apparitions in harmony with their &#8220;comfortable&#8221; life and beliefs, which in general do not include a very realistic fear of hell or awareness of demons.</p>
<p>On the objective side, the demons themselves offer temptations which accord with the spiritual state or expectations of those being tempted. For those who fear hell, the demons may appear in terrible forms in order to make a person die in a state of despair; but for those who do not believe in hell (or for Protestants who believe they are infallibly &#8220;saved&#8221; and therefore need not fear hell) the demons would naturally offer temptations in some other form that would not so clearly expose their evil intent. Likewise, even to a Christian struggler who has already suffered much, the demons may appear in such a way as to seduce him rather than frighten him.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The activity of demons</h4>
<blockquote><p>Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov: &#8220;The holy spirits avoid communion with men who are unworthy of such communion; while the fallen spirits, who have drawn us into their fall, have mingled with us and, so as the more easily to hold us in captivity, strive to make both themselves and their chains unnoticeable to us. And if they do reveal themselves, they do it in order to strengthen their dominion over us.&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov: &#8220;…the spirits who appear sensuously to men who are in a state of sinfulness and fall, are demons and not in the least holy angels. &#8216;A filthy soul,&#8217; said St. Isaac the Syrian, &#8221;does not enter the pure realm and is not joined to holy spirits&#8217; (Homily 74). Holy angels appear only to holy men who have restored communion with God and with them by a holy life.&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov: &#8220;The fallen angels are dispersed in a multitude throughout the entire transparent immensity which we see above us. They do not cease to disturb all human societies and every person separately; there is no evil deed, no crime, of which they might not be instigators and participants; they incline and instruct men towards sin by all possible means. <em>Your adversary the devil</em>, says the holy Apostle Peter, <em>walketh about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour</em> (1 Peter 5:8), both during our earthly life and after the separation of the soul from the body. When the soul of a Christian, leaving its earthly dwelling, begins to strive through the aerial spaces towards the homeland on high, the demons stop it, strive to find in it a kinship with themselves, their sinfulness, their fall, and to drag it down to the hell <em>prepared for the devil and his angels</em> (Matt. 25:41). They act thus by the right which they have acquired.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>The foolishness of seeking visions and spiritual experiences</h4>
<blockquote><p>Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov: &#8220;The desire to see spirits, curiosity to find out anything about them and from them, is a sign of the greatest foolishness and total ignorance of the Orthodox Church&#8217;s traditions concerning moral and active life. Knowledge of spirits is acquired quite differently than is supposed by the inexperienced and careless experimenter. Open communion with spirits for the inexperienced is the greatest misfortune, or serves as a source of the greatest misfortunes.&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov: &#8220;One who perceives spirits sensuously can easily be deceived to his own harm and perdition. If, on perceiving spirits, he shows trust or credulity towards them, he will unfailingly be deceived, he will unfailingly be attracted, he will unfailingly be sealed with the seal of deception, not understandable to the inexperienced, the seal of a frightful injury in his spirit; and further, the possibility of correction and salvation is often lost. This has happened with many, very many.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>Judgment after death</h4>
<blockquote><p>[Concerning] our redemption by Jesus Christ, [Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov says,] &#8220;all who have openly rejected the Redeemer comprise the inheritance of satan: their souls, after the separation from the body, descend straight to hell. But Christians who are inclined to sin are also unworthy of being immediately translated from earthly life to blessed eternity. Justice itself demands that these inclinations to sin, these betrayals of the Redeemer should be weighted and evaluated. A judging and distinguishing are required in order to define the degree of a Christian soul&#8217;s inclination to sin, in order to define what predominates in it&#8212;eternal life or eternal death. The unhypocritical Judgment of God awaits every Christian soul after its departure from the body, as the holy Apostle Paul has said: It is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment (Heb. 9:27).&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>What is certain is that there <em>is</em> a testing by demons, who appear in a frightful but human form, accuse the newly-departed of sins and literally try to seize the subtle body of the soul, which is grasped firmly by angels; and all this occurs in the air above us and can be seen by those whose eyes are open to spiritual reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-law-of-god">the Orthodox Church</a>, the initial judgment after death is called the &#8220;particular judgment.&#8221; Prayers can help the dead who have not fared well in this judgment, changing their eternal fate. The final judgment occurs on the Last Day and is, as you may have guessed, final.</p>
<h4>What exactly happens when you die?</h4>
<blockquote><p>St. Cyril: &#8220;What fear and trembling await you, O soul, in the day of death! You will see frightful, wild, cruel, unmerciful and shameful demons, like dark Ethiopians, standing before you. The very sight of them is worse than any torment. The soul, seeing them, becomes agitated, is disturbed, troubled, seeks to hide, hastens to the angels of God. The holy angels hold the soul; passing with them through the air and rising, it encounters the toll-houses which guard the path from earth to heaven, detaining the soul and hindering it from ascending further. Each toll-house tests the sins corresponding to it; each sin, each passion has its tax collectors and testers.&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>As a sensuous or &#8220;natural&#8221; experience, therefore, it would seem that death is indeed pleasant. This pleasantness may be experienced equally by one whose conscience is clean before God, and by one who does not deeply believe in God or eternal life at all, and therefore has no awareness of how he may have displeased God during his lifetime. A &#8220;bad death&#8221; is experienced, as one writer has well said, only by &#8220;those who know that God exists, and yet have lived their lives as though He did not&#8221;&#8212;i.e., those whose consciences torment them and counteract by their pain the natural &#8220;pleasure&#8221; of physical death. The distinction between believers and unbelievers occurs, then, not at the moment of death itself, but later, at the Particular Judgment. The &#8220;pleasantness&#8221; of death may be real enough, but it has no necessary connection whatever with the eternal fate of the soul, which may well be one of torment.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In the contemporary experiences the soul is most frequently offered a choice to remain in &#8220;paradise&#8221; or go back to earth; while the genuine experience of heaven occurs not by the choice of man but only at the command of God, fulfilled by His angels. The common &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experience of &#8220;paradise&#8221; in our days has no need of a guide because it takes place right here, in the air above us, still in this world; while the presence of the guiding angels is necessary if the experience takes place outside this world, in a different kind of reality, where the soul cannot go by itself. (This is not to say that demons cannot masquerade as &#8220;guiding angels&#8221; also, but they seldom seem to do so in today&#8217;s experiences.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Secular people are hung up on the delayed inevitability of physical death, and cope by distracting themselves in this life with <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/15-signs-youre-a-dopamine-slave">endless amusements</a> and doctor visits, but it&#8217;s really the potential for spiritual death that we should focus our labors on.</p>
<h4>Death experiences of the Saints</h4>
<blockquote><p>Saint Ignatius: &#8220;The great saints of God pass through the aerial guards of the dark powers with such great freedom because during earthly life they enter into uncompromising battle with them and, gaining the victory over them, acquire in the depths of their heart complete freedom from sin, become the temple and sanctuary of the Holy Spirit, making their rational dwelling-place inaccessible for the fallen angels.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>The aerial realm</h4>
<blockquote><p>The realm into which the soul immediately enters when it leaves the body and begins to lose contact with what we know as &#8220;material reality&#8221; (whether after death or in a simple &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experience) is neither heaven nor hell, but an invisible realm close to earth which is variously called the &#8220;After-death&#8221; or &#8220;Bardo plane&#8221; (Tibetan Book of the Dead), the &#8220;world of spirits&#8221; (Swedenborg and spiritism), the &#8220;astral plane&#8221; (Theosophy and most of occultism), &#8220;Locale II&#8221; (Monroe)&#8212;or, in Orthodox language, the aerial world of the under-heaven where fallen spirits dwell and are active in deceiving men for their damnation. This is not the &#8220;other world&#8221; that awaits man after death, but only the invisible part of <em>this</em> world that man must pass through to reach the truly &#8220;other&#8221; world of heaven or hell. For those who have truly died, and are being conducted by angels out of earthly life, this is the realm where the Particular Judgment begins at the aerial &#8220;toll-houses,&#8221; where the spirits of the air reveal their real nature and their hostility towards mankind; for all others, it is a realm of demonic deception at the hands of these same spirits.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The beings contacted in this realm are always (or almost always) demons, whether they are invoked by mediumism or other occult practices, or encountered in &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experiences. They are not angels, for these dwell in heaven and only pass through this realm as messengers of God. They are not the souls of the dead, for they dwell in heaven or hell and only pass through this realm immediately after death on their way to judgment for their actions in this life. Even those most adept in &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experiences cannot remain in this realm for long without danger of permanent separation from the body (death)&#8230;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Almost all contemporary researchers accept or at least are highly sympathetic to the occult teaching regarding this realm, for the single reason that it is based on experience, which is also the basis of science. But &#8220;experience&#8221; in the material world is something quite different from &#8220;experience&#8221; in the aerial realm. The raw material being experienced and studied in the one case is morally &#8220;neutral,&#8221; and it can be studied objectively and verified by others; but in the other case the &#8220;raw material&#8221; is hidden, extremely difficult to grasp, and, in many cases, has a will of its own&#8212;a will to deceive the observer.</p></blockquote>
<h4>What is really going on with modern near-death experiences?</h4>
<blockquote><p>The passage through the toll-houses&#8212;which is a kind of touchstone of authentic after-death experience&#8212;is not described at all in today&#8217;s experiences, and the reason for this is not far to seek. From many signs&#8212;the absence of the angels who come for the soul, the absence of judgment, the frivolousness of many of the accounts, even the very shortness of the time involved (usually some five to ten minutes, compared with the several hours to several days in the incidents from saint&#8217; Lives and other Orthodox sources)&#8212;it is clear that today&#8217;s experiences, although sometimes very striking and not explainable by any natural laws known to medical science, are not very profound. If these are actual experiences of death, then they involve only the very beginning of the soul&#8217;s after-death journey; they occur in the anteroom of death, as it were, before God&#8217;s decree for the soul has become final (manifested by the coming of the angels for the soul), while there is still a possibility for the soul to return to the body by natural means.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It is not precisely an &#8220;after-death&#8221; experience; it is rather the &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experience which is only the antechamber to other much more extensive experiences, whether of death itself or of what is sometimes called &#8220;astral travelling&#8221;… Although the &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; state might be called the &#8220;first moment&#8221; of death&#8212;if death actually follows&#8212;it is a gross mistake to conclude from it anything whatever about the &#8220;after-death&#8221; state, unless it be the bare facts of the survival and consciousness of the soul after death, which hardly anyone who actually believes in the soul&#8217;s immortality denies in any case.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an aerial realm above us that we cannot see because our spiritual eyes are shut. This aerial realm is infested with demons. When you die, your soul launches into the aerial realm for a brief period, where the demons can influence you with various visions, until the holy angels come down to begin your trial of particular judgment. Many <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/an-orthodox-examination-of-my-foolish-psychedelic-experience">psychedelic drugs</a> have the ability to put you in the aerial realm where what you see is almost certainly a demonic trick. Proof of this is the fact that very few psychedelic users interpret their &#8220;spiritual experiences&#8221; of the aerial realm in a way that steers them into the Orthodox Church. The vast majority fall back into a variety of pantheistic, gnostic, deistic, or New Age belief systems that are not sufficient for salvation.</p>
<h4>It is pleasing for the soul to separate from a body corrupted with sins</h4>
<blockquote><p>Our physical bodies in this fallen world are bodies of pain, corruption, and death. When separated from this body, the soul is immediately in a state more &#8220;natural&#8221; to it, closer to the state God intends for it; for the resurrected &#8220;spiritual body&#8221; in which man will dwell in the Kingdom of Heaven has more in common with the soul than with the body we know on earth.</p></blockquote>
<h4>What will our resurrected body be like?</h4>
<blockquote><p>[The] resurrected body, like that of Christ Himself, will be different from our earthly bodies in that it will be more refined and more like the angelic nature, without which it could not dwell in the Heavenly Kingdom, where there is no death or corruption; but it will still be the same body, miraculously restored and made fit by God for eternal life, as Ezekiel saw in his vision of the &#8220;dry bones&#8221; (Ezek. 37:1-14).</p></blockquote>
<h4>Erroneous concepts of heaven</h4>
<blockquote><p>…many Christians, in order to escape the mockery and unbelievers and avoid even the slightest taint of any materialistic conception, have gone to an opposite extreme and declare that heaven is &#8220;nowhere.&#8221; Among Roman Catholics and Protestants there are sophisticated apologies which proclaim that heaven is &#8220;a state, not a place,&#8221; that &#8220;up&#8221; is only a metaphor, the Ascension of Christ (Luke 24:50-51, Acts 1:9-11) was not really an &#8220;ascension,&#8221; but only a change of state. The result of such apologies is that heaven and hell become very vague and indefinite conceptions, and the sense of their reality begins to disappear&#8212;with disastrous results for Christian life, because these are the very realities toward which our whole earthly life is directed.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The Christian after-death experiences all affirm the existence of heaven, hell, and judgment, of the need for repentance, struggle, and fear of losing one&#8217;s soul eternally; while the contemporary experiences, like those of shamans, pagan initiates, and mediums, seem to point to a &#8220;summerland&#8221; of pleasant experiences in the &#8220;other world,&#8221; where there is no judgment but only &#8220;growth,&#8221; and death is not to be feared but only welcome as a &#8220;friend&#8221; that introduces one to the pleasures of &#8220;life after death.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>What to do when someone you know dies</h4>
<blockquote><p>As soon as someone has reposed, immediately call or inform a priest, so he can read the &#8220;Prayers on the Departure of the Soul,&#8221; which are appointed to be read over all Orthodox Christians after death. Try, if it be possible to have the funeral in church and to have the Psalter read over the deceased until the funeral. The funeral need not be performed elaborately, but most definitely it should be complete, without abbreviations; think at this time not of yourself and your convenience, but of the deceased, with whom you are parting forever.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The spiritual world is merging with ours</h4>
<blockquote><p>St. Gregory the Dialogist: &#8220;As the present world approaches its end, the world of eternity looms nearer… The end of the world merges with the beginning of eternal life… The spiritual world is moving closer to us, manifesting itself through visions and revelations.&#8221; The end of this world&#8217;s existence began with the coming of Christ, and sensitive souls are always seeing how the other world is &#8220;breaking into&#8221; this world ahead of time and giving &#8220;hints&#8221; of its existence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>The only way to heaven is through Lord Jesus Christ</h4>
<blockquote><p>The Church&#8217;s teaching is that whereas before our redemption by Christ, no one could pass through the air to heaven, the path being closed by demons, and all men went down to hell, now it has become possible for men to pass through the demons of the air, and their power now is restricted to men whose own sins convict them. In the same way, we know that even though Christ &#8220;destroyed the power of hell&#8221; (Kontakion of Pascha), any one of us can still fall into hell by rejecting salvation in Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see the toll-houses as a way for God to show you his just judgment. It&#8217;s a fair court trial with detailed evidence presented by your accusers&#8212;the demons&#8212;and defended competently by the holy angels. Whoever ends up in hell after the Last Judgment will have no doubt why they are there, and has no standing to whine that God is unfair or arbitrary. With <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soul-After-Death-Seraphim-Rose/dp/093863514X?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=cea994ebdb79104879501bacb34550a2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Soul After Death</a>, Father Seraphim Rose did a commendable job revealing the doctrine of death and the importance of believing in the truth instead of vague modern notions that try to exalt death for everyone, regardless of what type of lives they had. (For a podcast adaption of the book, listen to Father John Valadez&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sttimothy.net/index.php/2021/01/20/the-soul-after-death-lecture-series/">Soul After Death lecture series</a>. For a more academic approach to this topic, try Jean-Claude Larchet&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/after-Death-According-Orthodox-Tradition/dp/088465477X?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=ae260972e91142ead66f8e798abd2fc4&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Life After Death</a>.)</p>
<p>One caveat is that, unless you are firmly on the path of Orthodoxy, you will feel notions of despair about the perceived difficulty of being saved, at least from the anecdotes that were shared involving mostly monks who were greatly tried at their final hour. I purposefully did not share any of the hard sayings since my audience is not solely Orthodox. I cannot recommend this book to those not in the Orthodox Church except for those who have had near-death or out-of-body experiences and have fallen into a &#8220;spiritual but not religious&#8221; trap that needs to be corrected. If you&#8217;re Orthodox, this is essential reading to understand the stakes at hand.</p>

											<p>In this talk, which I gave on September 17 at <a href="https://tradforum.com/wp/">Trad Forum</a>, I share five common worldly attachments that I&#8217;ve been struggling with since becoming a Christian. I discuss my experiences with these attachments alongside advice from Orthodox Elders and Church Fathers. My hope with the talk is to help people identify all that may be competing with their love for God.</p>

											<p>When a man begins repentance, his heart is tender, contrite, and humble. He is ready to follow God&#8217;s commandments, obey Church teachings, and begin a new life in Christ. The problem is he is not yet fully healed, and still has elevated pride that is automatic for those who grew up in the West. Very soon, he may begin to make exemptions for himself concerning various sins or practices that he rationalizes as &#8220;small,&#8221; &#8220;temporary,&#8221; or serving the &#8220;greater good.&#8221; Satan&#8217;s foot is back in the door and will use his desire for exemptions to launch a strong attack that steals away the seed of new faith.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crime-Punishment-Fyodor-Dostoyevsky/dp/0486415872?content-id=amzn1.sym.97762c05-7545-47e0-ae5c-1110ba2791f0%3Aamzn1.sym.97762c05-7545-47e0-ae5c-1110ba2791f0&amp;cv_ct_cx=crime+and+punishment&amp;keywords=crime+and+punishment&amp;pd_rd_i=0486415872&amp;pd_rd_r=b07a6451-1f3b-44c9-b101-f9f1a0176224&amp;pd_rd_w=uywmT&amp;pd_rd_wg=A9caU&amp;pf_rd_p=97762c05-7545-47e0-ae5c-1110ba2791f0&amp;pf_rd_r=ATN60XGVXDVWHJHN97DC&amp;qid=1663798559&amp;sr=1-3-965fba24-1eed-4536-936e-b447f98a83bc&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=2ee6eb68b893143a6e65f86493690e1c&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Crime &amp; Punishment</a> by Fyodor Dostoevsky, the character Raskolnikov believes he is superior to his fellow man&#8212;so superior that he should have the right to kill someone if that person poses an obstacle to him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I simply hinted that an extraordinary man has the right… that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep… certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain persons who can… that is, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law is not for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Raskolnikov goes on to murder someone he thought was a detriment to mankind, and in the process of that murder he ended up killing a second person who happened upon the scene. By usurping the mantle of God, Raskolnikov thought that his intellectual powers gave him the ability to dispense with a perceived miscreant and scourge to society, but very soon he is overcome by a crushing guilt that he cannot silence.</p>
<p>Before my repentance, when I was living in Catholic Poland, I adhered to the concept of &#8220;cultural Christianity,&#8221; meaning that I saw the overall good that Christianity was doing to those who practiced the faith, but believed it was an &#8220;opiate for the masses,&#8221; a tool for merely average men and women who needed external rules to have peace in life instead of ravenously following their worldly desires and carnal passions. Since I thought I was an exalted man, bestowed with innumerable gifts, including intellectual, I was not required to follow Christian morality and could instead live without any limits to my behavior or actions. My feelings and will were supreme, just like Raskolnikov, and I created wholesale exemptions for myself to God&#8217;s law even though I saw moral benefit in it for mankind. I did not murder anyone physically, but by teaching sin so vigorously through my books and videos, I was an attempted murderer of the souls of men who used them to fornicate, and I aided in the corruption of women who had relations with me and the men who followed me. What peace did I have in this time? What calm entered my soul? I was <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/15-signs-youre-a-dopamine-slave">a dopamine junkie</a>, a slave to bodily pleasure, prone to anger, unstable in emotion, reeking of disgusting pride, and deluded into thinking that I could operate my mind and body in a way that was not intended by God. It took a family death to wake me up from my demonic delusion.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s common to meet unmarried Christian men who are in sexual relationships with women. They justify it by saying that they are &#8220;monogamous&#8221; and &#8220;will get married eventually,&#8221; but will such self-justification suffice upon Judgment Day? God&#8217;s law is clearly against fornication, adultery, and harlotry. No man is given a divine imperative to exempt himself. Do you really believe that God is pleased that you&#8217;re fornicating with &#8220;only&#8221; one woman at a time? From what I learned <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/what-is-orthodox-christianity">in the Orthodox Church</a>, such a man must stop fornicating until he gets married within the Church.</p>
<p>Even after I was received into the Church, I still made an exemption for myself that I can be the star of <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-end-of-roosh-hour">a popular live stream</a>, one that spiked my adrenaline and led to numerous sins stemming from pride. It took me months to follow the basic Church teaching of halting that which causes you to sin.</p>
<blockquote><p>True repentance is a change of the heart, and the change of evil ways into good ways. True repentance invariably creates shame and regret in the heart of the penitent, that he had acted so shamelessly and insubordinately toward God. There can be no true repentance when a man does not want to cease from sins and show obedience toward God. There is a delusional and false repentance, and therefore it is of no benefit to the penitent. For repentance and willful sinning are contrary things, and cannot exist together. &#8212;Saint Tikhon of Zadonsk in <a href="https://churchsupplies.jordanville.org/9780578235202/">On True Christianity Vol. 1</a></p></blockquote>
<p>God did not exempt me. I&#8217;m not exalted above others. I&#8217;m not a special boy. Without God, my natural gifts are more likely to be harnessed for evil than good. The morality we get from God is objective, clear, and for our eternal benefit; it&#8217;s our fallen weakness to shade it gray and think that God really wants us to transgress His law because we are somehow above it. Believing you can commit any type of sin to do a &#8220;favor&#8221; for God is delusion, and unfortunately, I am infected with it. What the Church teaches, I must abide, and if I ever get the notion that I don&#8217;t have to abide, I must conclude that a demon is whispering in my ear, and a damaging spiritual fall is near.</p>

<p>The Book of Acts continues where the Gospels left off and shows us how God further instructed the apostles through the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity. It&#8217;s also important in documenting the early history of the Church. <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-struggle-for-virtue">Archbishop Averky</a>, former abbot of Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York, offers a sound exegesis of the book in his volume <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acts-Apostles-Commentary-Holy-Scriptures/dp/1942699158?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=c64d536929e14dc411577d2be48e58cd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Acts of the Apostles</a>. My favorite passages are highlighted below.</p>
<h4>Why the book of Acts is so important</h4>
<blockquote><p>In this book, we see the fulfillment of those prophecies that the Lord uttered to His apostles in the Gospels. In it, we see the triumph of the faith of Christ over this fallen world, in spite of the human frailty of the apostles who had no money to ensure the success of their mission. In this book, we see how the apostles themselves became completely different people after the descent of the Holy Spirit. Fearlessly, with great self-rejection and courage, they preached the faith of Christ to the very end of the Greco-Roman civilized world, despite grievous persecutions. In a short time, they established many Christian communities who lived in the spirit of the commandments of the Gospels. The Book of Acts vividly shows us that the preaching of the Apostles was not the work of man, but of God…</p></blockquote>
<h4>Being filled with the Holy Spirit on Pentecost</h4>
<blockquote><p>Even before [Pentecost] the apostles were given some spiritual gifts, but now they were filled with the Holy Spirit, for the fullness of gracious spiritual gifts now had descended upon them. They were transfigured, purified, sanctified, and enlightened by the action of the Spirit of God. It was as if they became completely different, new people, with the Holy Spirit as their constant inspiration and guide. The external manifestation of this grace-filled transfiguration was the speaking in tongues, something that Christ Himself foretold (Mark 16:17). As soon as this divine fire lit their souls, they began to praise and thank God in the natural exuberance of their holy ecstasy, glorifying the majesty of God.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It was appropriate for the grace of the Spirit to be given on the same day as the giving of the ancient Law [Jewish Pentecost], because as the Saviour willed to commit Himself to His passion in no other time than the time of the killing of the lamb, in order to tie the truth with the prefiguration. Thus also the coming of the Spirit could not have been given at any other time than the day when the Law was given, in order to show that the Holy Spirit is the same Lawgiver of both the Old and the New Covenants… In the same way that on Pentecost sheaves of the new fruits were gathered by many people from many different places to Jerusalem, so on this day it was appropriate that the first fruits of all nations living under heaven should gather into a single sheaf of piety, brought to God through the apostolic preaching.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The foreknowledge of God</h4>
<blockquote><p>It is important to note that [God&#8217;s] foreknowledge does not destroy human free will, for the predestination of God, expressed in prophecy, is founded only on His foreknowledge. God knows how a person will use his free will, and depending on this free choice, God predestines.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The gift of the Holy Spirit to Orthodox Christians</h4>
<blockquote><p>Before the coming of Christ, the greater part of mankind, the Gentiles, were deprived completely of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, while grace was given to some of the Jews who were chosen for a special ministry. In Christianity, every one of the faithful receives these gifts of grace through the sacraments.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The beginning of Christian worship</h4>
<blockquote><p>Every day, the Christian community participated in worship at the Temple of Jerusalem. Christianity was not a sect within Judaism, but rather, it was the completion and fulfillment of true Judaism. The entirety of the temple worship was established on the expectation of the Messiah, and so Christians could freely worship in the Second Temple. Because the Christians believed in a Messiah who had already come, their own unique worship would need time to develop in a form distinct from the worship of the Old Testament Judaism.</p>
<p>The beginning of such unique Christian worship was the establishment of the sacrament of the Eucharist, which in Acts is called the &#8220;breaking of bread.&#8221; To celebrate this mystery, the first Christians gathered in private homes&#8212;&#8220;from house to house&#8221;&#8212;where the Eucharist would be served in conjunction with the evening agape meal. The general character of these Christian gatherings is characterized by these words: &#8220;with gladness and simplicity of heart.&#8221; This is the fruit of living faith and the purity of a heart deeply involved in a burgeoning spiritual life, illumined by the abundant gifts of the Holy Spirit. Because of this, Christians were a model of true piety, even for the rest of the Jews who did not believe in Christ. Therefore, many respected them as &#8220;having favor with all the people.&#8221; This favorable reputation of Christians was the reason for the gradual increase in converts, an event that St Luke ascribes to the work of the Lord Himself: &#8220;and the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>Receiving help from God</h4>
<blockquote><p>The more severe the persecutions of the newly established Church, the more manifest is the miraculous help of God. By the command of the angel, immediately upon their release, the apostles fearlessly returned to preaching openly in the temple. This remarkable boldness and courage can be explained only by the grace of the Holy Spirit encouraging their natural strength, making them fearless.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The mistakes of Protestants</h4>
<blockquote><p>…to the end of his days, [Apostle Paul] resolutely battled [the delusion that Christians must follow the Mosaic Law], and all his epistles are imbued with the thought that man is justified by faith in Christ, not by the works of the Law. This thought unfortunately has been perverted by the Protestants, who teach that good deeds are not necessary for salvation, even though Apostle Paul would never even think of maintaining such an idea. He insisted on the irrelevance of only the Mosaic Law for Christianity. &#8220;The works of the Law&#8221; refer only to the rites of the Law of Moses, not to good deeds in general.</p></blockquote>
<p>At only 120 pages, Archbishop Averky&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acts-Apostles-Commentary-Holy-Scriptures/dp/1942699158?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=c64d536929e14dc411577d2be48e58cd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Acts Of The Apostles</a> is a quick read that can be tackled alongside reading the Book of Acts.

											<p>Over the centuries, Christian courtship in the West has become distorted into seduction, and seduction into unbridled fornication, the &#8220;hookup culture&#8221; we have today. Seduction and romance were gateways to normalized sexual sin because they facilitated fallen man&#8217;s propensity to self-love through carnal pleasure. Adam and Eve&#8217;s innate desire to please and love God was transformed through the fall into a vulgar narcissism where we eagerly abuse and desecrate the bodies of others. To target someone and perform a set of behaviors in order for them to &#8220;like&#8221; you, and then harness those affections into sexual pleasure, is a side effect of demonic narcissism that is normalized in our time.</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of pleasing God and instead of the humility and obedience to the Law of God and the Holy Church commanded by Christ, there now flourishes as never before truly diabolical pride: self-love, conceit, self-glorification, self-exaltation, vanity which oozes out of every pore, and seeking after popularity and earthly glory. This all leads naturally to hatred, envy, malice, and uncontrollable hostility, leading at times to frenzy, instead of to the mutual love and goodwill commanded by the Gospel&#8230; &#8212;Archbishop Averky in <a href="https://archbishopaverky.blogspot.com/2020/05/enemies-of-orthodoxy-in-modern-world.html">Enemies Of Orthodoxy In The Modern World</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine what a modern woman does to attract a man she likes. She will wear tighter or more revealing clothing, put on lipstick to mimic the color of her lips during a state of arousal, stare deeply into his eyes as if he were the only reason for her existence, bite her lower lip, purposely allow her chest, hip, or shoulder to graze the man&#8217;s body, laugh purposefully at his jokes, feign interest in his hobbies, preen ceaselessly, apply chemical fragrances to her skin, and deliberately conceal her personal flaws. This is but a sample of the manipulative weapons a woman uses when she methodically targets a man&#8217;s lustful tendency to get him to desire her for sex or love.</p>
<p>Why does a woman do this? To feel the emotional pleasure of being desired, to be validated through a man&#8217;s attention, to create a narrative that displays social value to her friend group (i.e. brag), to alleviate boredom, and to fulfill her own physically lustful urges. Each of these reasons is for the self: <em>I want to feel good, I want to feel beautiful, I want to be desired, I want to experience physical ecstasy, I want to be loved, I want to be doted upon, I want to be happy, I want to be popular, I want to be in a relationship like my friends.</em> In such a seduction, the woman deceives herself into thinking that she likes the man, or even loves him, but in reality her behavior is a projection of her narcissism. She loves only herself, proven by the fact that there is no pure sacrifice or virtue displayed in the seduction&#8212;only the expectation of gain. If that gain is not forthcoming, she halts the seduction (often in anger) and moves on to another target who can elicit the desired outcome. She sees a man as a character in a play that she scripted to appeal to her imagination and long-held fantasies that developed since childhood from consuming thousands of hours of <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/why-do-you-consume-secular-content">secular entertainment and media</a>. In essence, seducing a man allows her to be the princess in her own movie, someone who a man would die for, the ultimate confirmation of her perceived self-worth.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s similar when a man is seducing a woman. A man will claim he is fornicating for the physical benefits alone, but he is all too eager to share tales of his conquests, highlighting his need for emotional validation concerning his masculine prowess. Sadly, I fornicated with many women in my past not because I strongly desired them, but because I wanted to bond with other men by sharing all the details of the seduction and be rewarded with their commendation or laughter. If you were to ask the old me why I dived so wholeheartedly <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/8-personal-defects-that-allowed-me-to-worship-fornication-for-18-years">into carnal sin</a>, he would answer you thus: <em>I want to feel good, I want to feel masculine, I want to have fun, I want to show off to other men, I want to assert my superiority over others or get their attention, I want to be challenged, I want to think of myself as special or skilled, I want to be popular, I want to be the hero of my own movie.</em> It was all done for my pleasure and egotistical needs. The women were merely supporting characters in the play that I had written myself for myself. It was so easy to forget about them after a short time because they were a mere instrument of my own pride and self-love.</p>
<p>For women, seduction is a gourmet meal while for men it&#8217;s like a trip to McDonald&#8217;s. Men want something quick and easy that fills the belly without a long wait, which is why it&#8217;s so much more common for a man to &#8220;take one for the team&#8221; than a woman. A man is more likely to see hooking up with any woman as a replacement for masturbation instead of the potentially life-changing narrative that women may prescribe to it. In both cases, the world revolves around the seducer and what he or she wants. The degree of patience may vary, whereby women are usually more patient than men since their sexual urges are less acute, but both use the other to receive material benefits, whether to the ego or to the body, and any authentic love or generosity displayed is only done to continue receiving benefits, remaining always transactional without serving a higher purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p>All of the Holy Fathers, teaching on the spiritual life, with one voice agree that the root and source of all the passions is egoism or self-love, that is, unreasonable, wrongful love towards oneself. Egoism or self-love gives rise to three principal passions the three fundament roots of all the other passions: love of pleasure, greed, and love of glory. These three principal passions are enumerated in the Holy Scripture by the Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian who says, Do not love the world or the things in the world… For all that is in the world&#8212;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&#8212;is not of the Father but is of the world (1 John 2:15-16). From these three principal passions in turn come the following eight passions: (1) gluttony, (2) fornication, (3) avarice, (4) anger, (5) sorrow, (6) despair, (7) vainglory, and (8) pride. These eight passions engender yet more and more passions which then branch out into a multitude of diverse and subtle variations of each of these principal passions. All of these innumerable passions tyrannize and torment the human heart, never giving a person rest and causing him unbearable suffering, from which he loses spiritual peace, inner balance, and tranquility of conscience. He feels deeply unhappy, sometimes experiencing truly hellish torment, as if experiencing the onset of those torments that inevitably await all unrepentant sinners… &#8212;Archbishop Averky in <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-struggle-for-virtue">The Struggle For Virtue</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s compare narcissistic seduction with Orthodox Christian courtship, where the <em>I</em> is removed and replaced with God. The self is no longer the main recipient of pleasure, happiness, or glory. Instead of a man using a woman as a vehicle for self-gratification, she is used as a vehicle to please God and serve His will for mankind. If a man identifies a woman he wants to marry, the questions on his mind will look entirely different compared to the narcissistic man: <em>Is this union pleasing to God? Is she the one that God wants me to marry? Is this union necessary to increase our faith and ultimately our salvation? What is the will of my Lord God?</em> Of course the woman must have some appealing traits, but the final decision to court her for marriage will depend not on personal satisfaction or pleasure but God&#8217;s good pleasure, which He can reveal to the man in time through a variety of methods. The me-centeredness of seduction is replaced with the God-centeredness of chaste courtship. The desire to receive pleasure is replaced by the desire to pick up a cross that pleases God and ultimately leads to salvation. Using a woman to receive bodily pleasure is replaced with loving a woman to receive divine pleasure (God&#8217;s grace).</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t possess the true faith of Orthodoxy, I deem it impossible to purely court for God instead of seduce for the self, even if you&#8217;re a &#8220;good person&#8221; and covet marriage for wholesome material goals. Subconsciously, you will seek out a woman who pleases you in the here and now, and since it&#8217;s typical that we attract a mate who is <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/you-attract-your-mirror-reflection">a mirror to our spiritual state</a>, you will attract a narcissist if you&#8217;re a narcissist. You will attract an egomaniac if you&#8217;re an egomaniac. You will attract a woman who is unconsciously serving Satan if you&#8217;re already serving Satan. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re a God-pleaser, you will attract a God-pleaser, for a God-hater will find it torturous to be with a God-pleaser. From this reality, it&#8217;s clear to see that the solution to finding the best spouse is to work on an Orthodox faith that is pleasing to God, but how many women instead devote their free time to makeup, clothing, or secular entertainment? How many men spend untold hours <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/4-reasons-why-lifting-in-gyms-is-a-bad-idea">building huge muscles</a> in a quest to spam a hundred women on Tinder after uploading shirt-less photos? Such behavior is surely a sign that more spiritual work must be done, because it&#8217;s only when we transcend the selfish needs of our flesh do we mature enough to enter a marriage with God at the helm.</p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has revealed to me that science is not what I believed it to be when I received a bachelor&#8217;s degree in microbiology in 2001. Instead of striving for the pure, unadulterated truth of the natural world, it has blatantly become an authoritarian vehicle to enslave and spiritually destroy human beings at the hands <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/bankers-rule-the-world">of oligarchs</a> who have the billions of dollars needed to fund science and therefore determine what is science. From my independent research into the germ theory of disease, which is the accepted theory of how we allegedly get sick from various pathogens, I can no longer say that I absolutely believe viruses are contagious.</p>
<p>A man who helped nudge me into my current belief is Dr. Tow Cowan, a medical doctor and researcher who has revealed the history of virology and other truths that were not taught to me in university. <a href="https://drtomcowan.com/products/breaking-the-spell-the-scientific-evidence-for-ending-the-covid-delusion?variant=41299699171481">Breaking The Spell</a> is a short 43-page book he wrote that reveals the sham of modern virology. After studying Dr. Cowan&#8217;s work and many others (see the reading list at the bottom of this article), I cannot in good conscience conclude that viruses are the main cause of respiratory illness and other diseases.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Contagion Myth -Session 1   Tom Cowan" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_soWxxZtCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>When I tell people that I don&#8217;t have a firm belief that viruses are contagious, they begin a series of &#8220;How about&#8230;&#8221; questions to which I sometimes have an answer and sometimes I don&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re new to virus skepticism, I hope the following passages from Dr. Cowan&#8217;s book and my explanations will be of aid.</p>
<h4>Epidemiological observations are not proof that viruses exist</h4>
<blockquote><p>For more than a hundred years, people observed that one sailor after another got sick on ships. Their teeth fell out, and many went into heart failure and died. For many, it was &#8220;obvious&#8221; that something was being passed&#8212;a contagion&#8212;from one sailor to the next. At some point, however, a sailor ate a lime; the whole thing went away because, in fact, the sick sailors were suffering from scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>There are many other examples illustrating how epidemiological observations have misled a medical profession stubbornly wedded to the idea of contagion. Beriberi and pellagra two well-known nutritional deficiencies, were considered for decades to be caused by a contagion. It turns out the case was B vitamin deficiency, which, as one would expect, would often show up in the same family members at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year, I came down <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/a-foretaste-of-my-deathbed">with a flu-like illness</a> while traveling. I returned home and then three days later, my mother came down with a similar but milder illness. It seemed quite intuitive that something was transmitted from me to my mother, but in spite of the timing, I cannot say with proof that a virus was transmitted. I have the epidemiological observation that my mother got sick three days after me, but if I want to say a virus caused it, I would need to prove it. Scientists have not proven that a viral particle floating in the air can be the cause of illness once inhaled, ingested, or transmitted through blood. If I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a virus in the case of me and my mother then what happened? I don&#8217;t know, but just because I don&#8217;t know, I will not hop onto a deceptively intuitive theory that does not have sufficient evidential backing. (Another intuitive theory that many have fallen for is <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-theory-of-evolution-is-incompatible-with-christianity">evolution</a>.)</p>
<p>Do you believe in a yawn virus? Probably not, but I&#8217;m sure it has happened to you that someone you were with yawned, and then almost immediately after, you also yawned. We don&#8217;t attribute such yawn contagion to a particle. Do you believe in a haircut virus? When I see a man with a nice haircut, I look in the mirror and evaluate if I need a haircut as well, and sometimes I get one soon after. Since it is theorized that diseases are the body&#8217;s method of expelling toxins, it could be that when you see someone who is sick, your body does an evaluation if it should also expel toxins. There are many other theories available that are beyond the scope of this introductory article, and I cannot claim to know the complete answer, but I have not seen credible evidence that virus particles are the cause of flu-like disease or otherwise.</p>
<p>During the Spanish influenza, Milton Rosenau was tasked with researching exactly how it was infecting humans. After a series of experiments, he was unable to infect <em>anyone</em> with the alleged virus (then called Pfeiffer&#8217;s bacillus). He went so far as getting sick people to cough and exchange fluids with healthy volunteers, and when that didn&#8217;t work, he took fluid from dead people&#8217;s lungs and tried to use that to infect people. It still didn&#8217;t infect anyone!</p>
<blockquote><p>As the preliminary trials proved negative, we became bolder, and selecting nineteen of our volunteers, gave each one of them a very large quantity of a mixture of thirteen different strains of the Pfeiffer bacillus, some of them obtained recently from the lungs at necropsy; others were subcultures of varying age, and each of the thirteen had, of course, a different history. Suspensions of these organisms were sprayed with an atomizer into the nose and into the eyes, and back into the throat, while the volunteers were breathing in. We used some billions of these organisms, according to our estimated counts, on each one of the volunteers, but none of them took sick. <a href="https://viroliegy.com/2021/10/03/the-infectious-myth-busted-part-1-the-rosenau-spanish-flu-experiments-1918/">The Infectious Myth Busted: The Rosenau Spanish Flu Experiments</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I know this may be hard for you to believe, since you were bombarded with viral theory when you are a child, and everyone you know believes in it, but <em>they have never proved that viral diseases are caused by viruses</em>. It&#8217;s just an intuitive theory that has been accepted as fact. When <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/babylon-road-9-rocky-mountains-hanging-lake-salt-lake-city">I go to national parks in the United States</a>, there are information placards that say a particular rock formation is billions of years old. That is presented confidently as fact, but it is also a mere theory (Orthodox Church doctrine puts <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/how-old-is-the-earth">the age of the earth</a> at about 7000 years).</p>
<h4>How are viruses &#8220;isolated&#8221;? (Hint: they&#8217;re not)</h4>
<blockquote><p>In the history of medicine, not one published study shows the isolation of identical particles that would represent a disease-causing virus from any bodily fluid from any sick person.</p>
<p>Let me make this even more clear. If one takes any person with any &#8220;viral&#8221; illness&#8212;for example, chicken pox, rabies, measles, AIDS or COVID-19&#8212;the published literature does not contain any evidence of any virus that was directly isolated from any bodily fluids from even one person suffering from these illnesses. The interesting thing about this statement is that no health institution from any government in the world disagrees.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8230;here are the steps Enders [the first scientist who &#8220;isolated&#8221; viruses&#8221;] outlined in his 1954 paper [describing viral isolation]. Enders started his experiment by taking a throat swab from seven children hospitalized with symptoms consistent with measles. He mixed the cotton swab with two milliliters of milk&#8212;interestingly, itself a source of genetic material. Then he added the throat swab in milk to a solution containing: &#8220;Penicillin, 100ug/ml and streptomycin, 50 mg/ml were added to all throat specimens which were then centrifuged at 5450 rpm for about one hour. Supernatant fluid and sediment resuspended in a small volume of milk were used as separate inocula in different experiments in amounts varying from 0.5 ml to 3.0 ml&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inocula&#8221; is just the sample used in the next step, which was to inoculate this material onto a culture of &#8220;trypsinized human and rhesus monkey kidney&#8221; cells. To this culture medium, he added the following: &#8220;The culture medium consisted of bovine amniotic fluid (90%), beef embryo extract (5%), horse serum (5%), antibiotics, and phenol red as an indicator of cell metabolism&#8221;.</p>
<p>In simple language, Enders mixed his sample with six other substances that are known to be sources of protein and genetic material. We now know that these substances break down into particles with the size and morphology of what are called viruses. These six sources are milk, human kidney cells, rhesus monkey kidney cells, bovine amniotic fluid, beef embryo extract and horse serum.</p>
<p>To this culture, Enders&#8217; research group next added antibiotics that are known to be toxic to the kidney cells, especially streptomycin. (Nowadays, scientists tend to use the antibiotics gentamicin and amphotericin.) Enders and colleagues then observed this brew over a number of days. When they saw a characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) in the cells of the cultures&#8212;meaning the transition of healthy, normal-sized culture cells into giant, disorganized cells with internal holes or vacuoles&#8212;they concluded that these were proof that the virus from the throat swab was destroying the cells in the culture. To Enders, this cytopathic effect was the hallmark of dying cells, and he believed it could only have occurred because the virus in the measles sample infected and destroyed the cells in the culture.</p>
<p>To this day, with minor exceptions, every &#8220;viral isolation&#8221; starts with this flawed culturing process. Furthermore, every genetic analysis of any purported virus is done on the results of this cell culture, not on an isolated, purified virus. No exceptions. Thus, if virologists want to elucidate the genome of a new virus, they don&#8217;t isolate the virus from a sick person and sequence that specific particle. Rather, they take an unpurified sample from a sick person, run it through a tissue culture (as described above) and do their analysis on the resulting mixture&#8212;not on the virus itself.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>…every &#8220;live-viral vaccine&#8221; basically is nothing more than a partly purified (minimally filtered) cell culture mixture.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Today, virologists refer to the inevitable breakdown products of dead and dying tissues as extracellular vesicles or sometimes as &#8220;exosomes.&#8221; These particles can be isolated and purified directly from bodily fluids of sick people. They are conceptually different from viruses in that viruses supposedly come from outside the person and, at least sometimes, are considered pathogens. EVs come from the breakdown of the person&#8217;s own tissues and are non-pathogenic. And, as of May 2020, virologists acknowledged that they can&#8217;t distinguish between the two. There is only one realistic explanation for this. All particles with the size, composition and morphology of &#8220;viruses&#8221; are, in reality, the normal and inevitable results of the breakdown of our own tissues. And our tissues break down for the same reason as the cultures in Enders&#8217; experiments broke down: They&#8217;re either starved, poisoned or both. Dying tissues produce a myriad of particles, and these particles have unfortunately been mistaken for pathogenic, exogenous viruses. It&#8217;s time to clear up this misconception.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I hand you a canister and tell you it&#8217;s gasoline, you will assume that the liquid inside is only gasoline. If I give you a bottle of extra virgin olive oil, you will assume it only has extra virgin olive oil without adulterants. With virus isolation, however, you&#8217;re getting a potpourri of genetic and medicinal junk in addition to the alleged virus. A virus &#8220;isolate&#8221; is anything but. They have not isolated any viruses, so whenever you hear in the news that a new virus has been isolated, they are using a definition of isolation that is quite different than what you would expect by the word &#8220;isolation.&#8221; To help convince you of their sham, they will say they&#8217;ve used electron microscopes and various dyes, pointing with a soy meme expression that the little particles are viruses that will go on to infect other human beings, when really it&#8217;s just cell junk and debris that is created when you expose healthy mammalian cells of various animals to a toxic brew.</p>
<h4>Coronavirus spike proteins are only seen after adding protein-digesting enzymes</h4>
<blockquote><p>The authors [in a paper announcing the discover of coronavirus spike proteins] then describe the electron micrographs done on the resulting culture fluid: &#8220;Electron micrographs of sectioned Vero/hSLAM cells showed cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicles containing coronavirus particles. Following several failures to recover virions with the characteristic fringe of surface spike proteins, it was found that adding trypsin to the cell culture medium immediately improved virion morphology.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the particles the Australian researchers call &#8220;coronaviruses&#8221; included the characteristic halo of spike proteins only after the investigators added trypsin to the culture medium. Trypsin is a protein-digesting enzyme; viruses are alleged to have a protein &#8220;coat.&#8221; It would be reasonable to assume that if one adds protein-digesting enzymes to particles with a protein coating, some of the protein coating will be eaten away, leaving a final particle that might look in an electron micrograph as if it has spikes. This lab-induced result obviously would bear no relationship to what such a particle might look like inside a live person.</p>
<p>There is only one rational, logical and scientific conclusion that one can draw from this paper: These researchers had no idea what made the Vero/hSLAM cells break down. Moreover, they had no idea where any genetic material they subsequently tested for originated. Finally, they did not find any particle with the characteristic morphology of a coronavirus until they manufactured its appearance. In sum, there is no evidence in this paper that any particle known as SARS-CoV-2 was found, or that any virus had anything to do with this Australian person&#8217;s illness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spike proteins are a laboratory-made creation. They have not been observed in human tissue nor isolated from them. They do not exist naturally. If you&#8217;re watching a video of a based scientist who is telling you the &#8220;truth&#8221; of spike proteins as compared to establishment scientists, he is also far from the truth, despite his good intentions. Starting in the year 2020, there has been a wave of illnesses around the world, but I do not believe it is caused by coronavirus or spike proteins, and any research or content that discusses these alleged particles as the cause of illness is probably a waste of your time.</p>
<h4>The coronavirus PCR test is actually a test for common human, bacterial, and fungal DNA</h4>
<blockquote><p>Doing a BLAST search for the Drosten primer sequences [of SARS-CoV-2], Davis came up with more than 90 matching sequences in the human genome and more than 90 matching sequences in the microbial world. This finding means that the primer sequences being used in RT-PCR testing to identify &#8220;SARS-CoV-2&#8221; could be possibly of human or microbial (bacterial, fungal, etc.) origin. Any claims that these PCR primer sequences are unique to SARS-CoV-2 are, therefore, false.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>…all illness creates genetic debris, and similar illnesses cause similar patterns of genetic breakdown. When these patterns are picked up by the PCR process and erroneously used as a diagnostic test, that is when we run into trouble.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The biggest danger of using the PCR process as a diagnostic test is that the number of cycles will determine the percentage of positives and negatives. Any PCR &#8220;test&#8221; done with 25 or fewer cycles is likely to be negative in almost every case. With that amount of amplification, one rarely is able to pick up the primer sequence in question. On the other hand, if the amplification cycles are above 40, almost everyone will test positive because those sequences are present in every human-and every human has a baseline of tissue breakdown happening all the time.</p>
<p>The implications of this feature of the PCR process are clear. If any tyrant wanted to show that there was a &#8220;viral pandemic,&#8221; all they would have to do is increase the cycle numbers to more than 40. If they then wanted to show that whatever intervention they were using to combat this &#8220;pandemic&#8221; was helping, they could just lower the cycles to fewer than 25. Suddenly, all those &#8220;positive&#8221; cases would become &#8220;negative&#8221; simply because the sensitivity of the test was altered.</p>
<p>The only way to combat this potential fraud is to eliminate the use of any PCR process as a diagnostic test.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people I know have fallen for the &#8220;coronavirus is infectious&#8221; sham and relay their adventures with clinical testing. Today they test negative, and three days later they still test negative, and then a day after that they test positive. From my observation, those who don&#8217;t have symptoms seem more likely to test positive. Coronavirus testing is a spin of the roulette wheel because it does not test for what it claims to test. Instead of testing for a virus, it&#8217;s actually testing for burrowed pieces of your own DNA that sometimes shows up on the test. The result it generates could be completely random.</p>
<p>Dr. Cowan&#8217;s explanation of the virus sham is thorough, logical, elegant, and clear, because instead of merely theorizing, he&#8217;s deconstructing the research papers from the virologists themselves who have made claims that later became normalized in <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/western-medicine-is-dead">medical science</a>. He&#8217;s using the words and techniques of the scientists to show how ridiculous their research and &#8220;isolation&#8221; really is. This means that the viral model for disease is a theory, just like the theory of evolution, and we already know how wrong that theory is. Scientists have not isolated viruses and have not proved they cause disease unlike with bacteria or parasites. Something is being communicated when you get sick after spending time with someone else who is sick, but there is absolutely no proof that it&#8217;s a virus.</p>
<p>After Dr. Cowan debunks modern medicine, he then theorizes about what he believes is really going on. This is where he loses me. In the last chapter of his book, he proposes a theory of water crystallization that ends up deifying water and how it can rearrange itself ad-hoc into needed biochemical structures. He stresses this is just a theory, but it&#8217;s one I do not accept. I did discover that Dr. Cowan believes in a spiritual reality, which is more than most modern scientists who are pompously atheist. I find that scientists who at least believe in God are more likely to be closer to the truth of our material world.</p>
<p>Scientists in the 20th century were sure that certain diseases were spreading from person to person, but they were being caused by something other than bacteria, parasites, or fungi. So what did they do? They invented a particle called the virus to solve the problem. All the scientists who believed in emerging viral theory went on to receive much acclaim, prestige, and financial success as many billions of research dollars poured into an exciting new field that was extremely profitable to pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines, which are essentially soups of cell culture mixed with toxic preservatives. Lies seem to have a momentum of their own, and viruses are just one of many lies that the average secular person believes in. (Ironically, I think that scientists may have created or become close to creating a man-made virus, or at least harmful biological matter that has a greater ability to spread than purely chemical agents.)</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s causing illness? I don&#8217;t know, but I do have my suspicions about <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/stop-eating-seed-oils-challenge">seed oils</a>, environmental toxins, and electromagnetic waves. The fascinating and well-researched book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Rainbow-History-Electricity-Life-ebook/dp/B084SZW2LC?keywords=invisible+rainbow&amp;qid=1661878726&amp;sr=8-1&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=1c2dbd908616d22730547b3cbfe21d41&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Invisible Rainbow</a> makes a very strong case that every stepwise advancement in radio and telecommunications technology has resulted in a worldwide &#8220;pandemic.&#8221; Getting sick from electromagnetic waves would end up having a similar epidemiology to person-to-person transmission. How else can we explain why sailors far at sea would get sick with flu-like illnesses at the same time as those on land?</p>
<blockquote><p>If influenza is primarily an electrical disease, a response to an electrical disturbance of the atmosphere, then it is not contagious in the ordinary sense. The patterns of its epidemics should prove this, and they do.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>“The English warship Arachne was cruising off the coast of Cuba ‘without any contact with land.’ No less than 114 men out of a crew of 149 fell ill with influenza and only later was it learnt that there had been outbreaks in Cuba at the same time.”</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>During the 1918–1919 pandemic, monkeys and baboons perished in great numbers in South Africa and Madagascar, sheep in northwest England, horses in France, moose in northern Canada, and buffalo in Yellowstone.47 There is no mystery here. We are not catching the flu from animals, nor they from us. If influenza is caused by abnormal electromagnetic conditions in the atmosphere, then it affects all living things at the same time, including living things that don’t share the same viruses or live closely with one another. &#8212;The Invisible Rainbow</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is your first exposure to the &#8220;viruses aren&#8217;t contagious&#8221; position, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re skeptical and filled with questions, because I sure was. This article is not meant to be exhaustive, and cannot possibly answer all of your &#8220;what ifs&#8221; and &#8220;how abouts,&#8221; but as a truth-seeker, where truth is all that is from God, I can no longer believe in modern viral theory without question. The theory does seem intuitive at first glance from our own epidemiological experiences, but the facts don&#8217;t support the existence of a transmissible virus. I need to see direct, causative proof and not mere correlation or conjecture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have the absolute truth of why we get various illnesses, and while industrial food and EMF radiation are strong contenders as causes, it seems that God does not want us to know everything about disease and illness, and He is using them as part of His plan to save the souls of men. People of old never thought that diseases were caused by particles but instead were the result of God&#8217;s will; perhaps that is where we must return. I don&#8217;t believe in the scientists, but I do believe in God, so whatever the cause of the next disease I have, may His will be done.</p>

											<p>The &#8220;hangry&#8221; meme is real. If you don&#8217;t eat for a while, you are more susceptible to the negative states of anger and irritation than if you were sated. This poses a problem for Orthodox Christians, who fast from animal products for about half the calendar year, not only abstaining from certain types of food but also reducing overall portion sizes. How can we perform the fast without falling into grumpiness that may open the door to passionate sins?</p>
<blockquote><p>Can anyone think that where there is no prayer and fasting, the devil is already there? One can! &#8212;Saint Theophan the Recluse</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Anyone who rejects the effort of prayer and fasting is capable of doing nothing but evil&#8212;and all his apparent good, if he has any, is in truth not good at all, but also evil; because according to Christ&#8217;s words: &#8220;A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit&#8221;: &#8220;do men gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?&#8221; (Matt. 7:18,16). &#8220;Beware,&#8221; Christ therefore says, &#8220;of false prophets which come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves&#8221; (Matt. 7:15). &#8212;<a href="https://archbishopaverky.blogspot.com/2019/02/bearing-cross.html">Archbishop Averky</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key to understanding your mood in a state of hunger is blood glucose. After you eat a meal that contains glucose, which is found in sugars and carbohydrates, your body shuttles that glucose to your muscles and brain, where it is used as an immediate and accessible energy source. For the glucose that is not immediately utilized, your body converts it to glycogen. As an analogy, we can liken glycogen to glucose stored in a closed bottle and put on the shelf (it&#8217;s actually multiple glucose molecules chained together).</p>
<p>Depending on your unique physiology, your blood glucose concentration will dip 2-3 hours after eating. Your brain and muscles continually need glucose, so through a complex mechanism called glycogenolysis, the &#8220;bottle of glucose&#8221; (glycogen) is retrieved from the shelf and opened to release the amount of glucose that is needed for you to function normally.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15921" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-1024x765.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="530" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-768x574.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-1536x1147.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-1060x792.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-550x411.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-669x500.jpg 669w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-1446x1080.jpg 1446w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose-600x448.jpg 600w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blood-glucose.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>The amount of glycogen stored in your body is not unlimited: you have about 2,000 calories worth stored in your muscles and liver. If you&#8217;re an athlete and hit the &#8220;wall&#8221; during intense activity, unable to perform further, you have <a href="https://8fit.com/fitness/glycogen-depletion-signs-symptoms-and-working-out/">used up all of your glycogen</a> (and free glucose). You have run out of gas, so to speak, but you do not need to be an athlete to run out of preferred energy stores. It is estimated that a sedentary person who is fasting from food will extinguish all their glycogen in 12-22 hours, and that will depend on their muscular physique, metabolism, and general level of activity.</p>
<p>If you run out of glycogen and do not have an immediate food source, do you soon die? No, our all-wise God has implanted an exceedingly complex mechanism in the animal world called gluconeogenesis which converts fat into glucose. What&#8217;s amazing about the gluconeogenesis pathway is that fats contain no glucose molecules at all, but God has easily found a way to make the chemistry work. Gluconeogenesis will occur during prolonged exercise and fasting, or if you&#8217;re eating a low-carb diet. There&#8217;s only one major issue with gluconeogenesis: it&#8217;s slow.</p>
<p>Your body can convert glycogen to glucose pretty fast, but converting fats to glucose takes more time and happens in a stepwise fashion like a home thermostat slowly arriving at a set temperature. Therefore, if you&#8217;re all out of glycogen, you will enter a state where your body does not have a preferred energy source. During that time, you will begin to feel the classic symptoms of fatigue, mood irritation (i.e. &#8220;hangry&#8221;), bodily weakness, and even pain in the form of headaches.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m hungry, and have not eaten for over 12 hours, I often enter a state of irritation. I&#8217;m much <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-psychology-of-complaining">more likely to complain</a> and snap at those who are close to me for the most trivial of reasons. I&#8217;ve since learned to <em>not talk at all</em> when I&#8217;m hungry, at risk of saying something I regret. Spiritually, I was told by a monk that not eating reveals the naked state of your being when it&#8217;s not being sated with food or some other pleasure. I have a history of anger and irritation, so when I&#8217;m not being fed, those problems are able to directly rise to the surface. Modern scientists theorize (i.e. guess) that glucose is needed to control the willpower centers of the brain. When your brain doesn&#8217;t have glucose, they say, it shuts down the willpower to be a decent human being.</p>
<p>I would have believed the biological theory if I wasn&#8217;t an <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/what-is-orthodox-christianity">Orthodox Christian</a>, where states of grace can transcend the body&#8217;s immediate biological needs. This year, I went to a monastery for the first week of Lent. For several days in a row, I was able to eat the one served meal a day, something I had never done before, and experienced no irritation or anger. I didn&#8217;t even feel weak. The reason is I was attending several hours a day of services. My soul was able to use any grace received from the services to supplant my body&#8217;s need for food, but then the grace ended and I could not stop thinking of food. I again felt the desire to eat multiple times a day along with sharp periods of irritation.</p>
<p>There is certainly a biological reality, for we do exist in the body, but it does not supplant the spiritual reality of grace that God gives to our soul at His discretion. An Orthodox Christian only needs to read the lives of the saints to see countless examples of men eating only bread and salt for prolonged periods. It&#8217;s not that these saints were anatomical supermen like professional athletes, but they so pleased God that their faith was able to suspend biological laws by grace for a sustained period.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m at home and only attending one or two divine services a week, I don&#8217;t have much in the way fasting grace, and every day is a struggle. I&#8217;m tempted to eat three meals a day or else I&#8217;m grumpy and can&#8217;t take my mind off food. From these struggles, here are five things I&#8217;ve learned on my quest to fast better&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. If I&#8217;m getting angry and cannot control my thoughts or speech, it&#8217;s better to eat.</strong> Our faith is a faith of love, so if you&#8217;re a heroic faster but you&#8217;re having angry thoughts or actually attacking those close to you, you may be missing the point of the fast.</p>
<p><strong>2. It takes about 30-120 minutes for your mood to be restored after eating. </strong>The bigger the meal you eat, the longer it will take for your body to digest the glucose. For an acute attack, you can try eating a couple tablespoons of honey with a slice of bread for faster relief.</p>
<p><strong>3. It&#8217;s easier to fast for yourself than to fast for God.</strong> Before I came to Christ, I often did intermittent fasting and regularly went for 18 hours without eating. The reason I fasted was to improve my appearance to aid in achieving sin with women. Satan helped me every step of the way, and I did not notice being grumpy or having angry thoughts, probably because I liked my passions and thought it was an irrevocable part of <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/who-are-you">my identity</a>. To do the Orthodox fast is significantly harder because there is no worldly gain from it and the standard of Christian love is quite high.</p>

<p><strong>4. Moderate bodybuilding can make you ravenously hungry.</strong> If I don&#8217;t do any workouts, and sit in front of my computer all day, I can eat two medium-sized meals without too many tears, but if I just do a little callisthenic training, I become rather hungry on the day of the exercise and the day after, and when I do eat, I have to fight the temptation to eat big. For fasting periods like Lent, you may want to <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/4-reasons-why-lifting-in-gyms-is-a-bad-idea">tone down your workouts</a> so that your fasting is not unnecessary hard.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don&#8217;t immediately run to the pantry upon the first hunger pain.</strong> You won&#8217;t starve, though you may be tempted to believe so. I wait an hour for the sharp hunger pain to morph more into a dull ache.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the mark of Christianity: however much a man toils and however many righteous acts he performs; he must feel that he has done nothing. In fasting he must say, &#8220;This is not fasting,&#8221; and in praying, &#8220;I have not prayed,&#8221; and in perseverance at prayer, &#8220;I have shown no perseverance; I am only just beginning to practice asceticism and to take pains.&#8221; And even if he is righteous before God, he should say, &#8220;I am not righteous, not I; I do not struggle, but barely make a beginning each day.&#8221; &#8212;Saint Makarios of Egypt in <a href="https://stanthonysmonastery.org/products/the-fifty-spiritual-homilies">The Fifty Spiritual Homilies</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a mediocre faster at best. I can abide by the dietary restrictions without much anguish, but I still eat a good amount and do not always lose weight during prolonged fasts. In times of grace where my prayer is strong and I&#8217;m attending daily services, I can fast harder, but while at home I am able to only do the bare minimum. Thankfully, God does grade us based on effort and struggle instead of pounds lost. With the knowledge of how my body works, and the fact that fasting separates me from the world to draw nearer to God, I continue to fast, and hope that my fasting becomes stronger in the years to come.</p>

											<p>Sometimes I wonder what is the most essential ingredient that makes me, me. Over the years I had many ideas of who I was, but it turned out that I was none of those things. And then I was absolutely sure I was other things, more internal things, but I was not those either, and the question remained unanswered.</p>
<p>In university, I thought I was my grades. If I got good grades, I was told, I would get a high-paying job and eventually be happy. If my grades were higher than my peers, I felt smarter than them, and if my grades were lower, I felt dumber. In the end, when my schooling was completed and I began to live a <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/secular-success-vs-christian-success">standard secular life</a>, I discovered that I was not my grades.</p>
<p>As an adult, away from my parent&#8217;s nest, I thought I was my income, my car, my possessions. I thought what I owned would define me and differentiate me. If my income was higher than others, I was more successful than them, a better person, and if it was lower, I was inferior. My stuff had to be better than other people&#8217;s stuff, but in the end, I discovered that I was not the items I own or what is in my bank account.</p>
<p>Then I fell for the idea that I was my experiences, particularly my travel experiences and relations with women. The countries I visited would define me; the women I fell with would make up my identity. I was a traveler, a &#8220;player.&#8221; If I had traveled to more countries or slept with more women than you, I thought I was superior to you, but in the end, I discovered I was nothing external to me, nothing that could be grasped in this material world.</p>
<blockquote><p>When someone is empty of Christ then a thousand and one other things come to fill his soul: jealousies, hatreds, boredom, melancholy, negativity, a worldly frame of mind and worldly pleasures. Try to fill your soul with Christ so as not to have it empty. Your soul is like a cistern full of water. If you channel the water to the flowers, that is, to the virtues, you will experience true joy and all the thorns of evil will wither away. But if you channel the water to the weeds, these will grow and choke you and all the flowers will wither. &#8212;Saint Porphyrios in <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/learning-to-love-god">Wounded By Love</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So I must be my personality. I am my sense of humor, my quirks, my demeanor, my attitude. I am all the things that cannot be precisely duplicated in anyone else. If I made more people laugh than you, I had a better personality. If more people wanted to hear what I had to say, I was more interesting. I cannot so easily say that my personality is not me, because if it is not me then what is me? But then I asked, where exactly does my humor come from? Does it really come from inside me or was it influenced over the years by factors outside of me and by the milieu I live in? Does not my quirks, demeanor, and attitude, come mostly from my parents and upbringing? Doesn&#8217;t the way I act come mostly from wanting to become some kind of ideal of a man as defined by the culture? In the end, I had to conclude that I was not exactly my personality, which to my surprise has changed in major ways over the past few years <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/gods-revelation-to-the-human-heart">through God&#8217;s grace</a>.</p>
<p>I got it: I must be my thoughts. Many people have told me that I&#8217;m &#8220;sharp&#8221; and &#8220;intelligent,&#8221; and this must be because of the way my brain works on a functional, biological level. It is unique and solely mine, irreplaceable and unchangeable. My thoughts are definitely me&#8230; until they come <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/demons-can-put-thoughts-into-your-mind">from the demons</a> in the form of judgments, temptations, and vulgarities. Or until they come from God or His angels in the inspiration to do a good deed. How can my thoughts be &#8220;me&#8221; if they can derive from beings external to me, if I can serve as a vessel for unseen spiritual forces? In fact, I cannot even prove to you that the words written here are definitively from me and me alone. In the end, I concluded that my thoughts are not solely me, and neither is anything else that allows me to compare myself with others in any way.</p>

<p>There is not much else I can declare as being me. It can&#8217;t be my body, which is constantly changing and will soon not be mine when I die. It can&#8217;t be my relationships with other people, which are also changing by the day. It&#8217;s not the foods I eat, the way I pray, or even <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-salvation-of-your-soul-is-not-a-game">my favorite books</a>. No, those are all external; they aren&#8217;t me. So who am I? There is something in me that is &#8220;me&#8221; but I can&#8217;t grasp it with my hands or my mind.</p>
<p>One evening, in a state of contemplation, I looked up at one of my icons of Lord Jesus Christ. I asked Him, &#8220;Lord, who am I?&#8221; I stared at the icon for some time and then I felt a warmth in my heart, and the thought that came to me was, &#8220;You are a creature of God who can perceive God and give glory to Him, and behold His beauty with indescribable joy for all eternity.&#8221; And that thought seemed correct to me, that the &#8220;I&#8221; in I is a soul, a spiritual vessel, to recognize the God of all creation, the only faculty which makes me me, which will stay with me forever, and that I can only be defined according to my relationship with my Creator, and all that is separate or apart from my relationship with God is not me, and will soon pass away, and how eagerly do I await the day that I can commune in divine fullness, clarity, and love with the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit, unto the ages of ages.</p>

											<p>In the spring of 2019, approximately two weeks after I started a daily prayer rule upon taking my first steps as a Christian, I took psychedelic mushrooms, something that I would not dare do today. Nonetheless, it happened, and I&#8217;d like to offer commentary on the out-of-body experience I had through the eyes of my growing Orthodox understanding.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/what-happened-when-i-took-psychedelic-mushrooms">a recounting of the event that happened</a> while I was under the influence of the mushrooms:</p>
<blockquote><p>I turned to lay on the right side of my body, almost in a fetal position, and closed my eyes once more. The geometric patterns were gone, my vision all black. My breathing became labored once again. My chest felt like it was being wrung out from the center. I tried to be careful with my breaths to make sure I received enough air.</p>
<p>The sound of my breaths was still loud, but now they were becoming spaced further and further apart. Don’t be afraid, I said to myself. Then the sound of the air entering my lungs went silent. I was no longer breathing. I could not perceive myself as breathing. I tried to open my eyes, but I couldn’t. Then I tried to wave my hands in front of my face, but nothing happened. I was no longer in my body. Then whoosh—I felt a great movement at amazing speed as if I was transported somewhere else.</p>
<p>I was placed in a great void. My breath was gone, my body was gone. I couldn’t hear Albert [my friend] or any sounds of the forest. And yet I was not afraid or worried. There was no concern for what happened to my body or if I would ever possess it again. There was no lamentation that I could not continue experiencing the world as I have for my previous 39 years of existence. In this great void, with no sign of stars or other physical matter, or even the perception of space or time, I felt complete serenity and peace with myself.</p>
<p>Then a large dome with a gray outline came into view. The bottom of the dome was flat. In the center of the flat bottom was a white light. I stared at the light and a warm feeling overcame me. The word “home” entered my mind. That [could be] the home of my soul, where I came from and where I will go back to, where I will rest for all eternal. I desired to be with the light, to float towards it, but then my eyes opened.</p>
<p>I was back in the forest, curled up on the ground. I took a deep breath and stood up. I wanted to talk to Albert but I had no voice.</p></blockquote>
<p>What happened to my body? What did I see? <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-best-book-for-orthodox-christian-converts">Father Seraphim Rose</a> of blessed memory has offered the most likely answers to these questions in his important book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soul-After-Death-Seraphim-Rose/dp/093863514X?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=51fc03d2125b24f195935f2d04008449&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Soul After Death</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A near-death experience] is not precisely an &#8220;after-death&#8221; experience; it is rather the &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experience which is only the antechamber to other much more extensive experiences, whether of death itself or of what is sometimes called &#8220;astral travelling&#8221;… Although the &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; state might be called the &#8220;first moment&#8221; of death&#8212;if death actually follows&#8212;it is a gross mistake to conclude from it anything whatever about the &#8220;after-death&#8221; state, unless it be the bare facts of the survival and consciousness of the soul after death, which hardly anyone who actually believes in the soul&#8217;s immortality denies in any case.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The beings contacted in this realm are always (or almost always) demons, whether they are invoked by mediumism or other occult practices, or encountered in &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experiences. They are not angels, for these dwell in heaven and only pass through this realm as messengers of God. They are not the souls of the dead, for they dwell in heaven or hell and only pass through this realm immediately after death on their way to judgment for their actions in this life. Even those most adept in &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experiences cannot remain in this realm for long without danger of permanent separation from the body (death), and even in occult literature such adepts are rarely described as meeting each other.</p></blockquote>
<p>From Father Seraphim&#8217;s teachings, my understanding of death and the toll houses as taught by the <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-desert-fathers">Church Fathers</a>, and my own contemplation of the experience, I&#8217;d like to pose three inferences about what happened.</p>
<p>First, I believe that my soul did leave the body for a period of time and enter the aerial realm (the antechamber to heaven or hell). In Church teachings highlighted by Father Seraphim, this is the realm where angels come to take your soul upon bodily death in an attempted ascent to heaven, but if you have failed to please God in your life, your ascent will fail and demons will pull you down to hell. Father Seraphim explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>The realm into which the soul immediately enters when it leaves the body and begins to lose contact with what we know as &#8220;material reality&#8221; (whether after death or in a simple &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experience) is neither heaven nor hell, but an invisible realm close to earth which is variously called the &#8220;After-death&#8221; or &#8220;Bardo plane&#8221; (Tibetan Book of the Dead), the &#8220;world of spirits&#8221; (Swedenborg and spiritism), the &#8220;astral plane&#8221; (Theosophy and most of occultism), &#8220;Locale II&#8221; (Monroe)&#8212;or, in Orthodox language, the aerial world of the under-heaven where fallen spirits dwell and are active in deceiving men for their damnation. This is not the &#8220;other world&#8221; that awaits man after death, but only the invisible part of this world that man must pass through to reach the truly &#8220;other&#8221; world of heaven or hell. For those who have truly died, and are being conducted by angels out of earthly life, this is the realm where the Particular Judgment begins at the aerial &#8220;toll-houses,&#8221; where the spirits of the air reveal their real nature and their hostility towards mankind; for all others, it is a realm of demonic deception at the hands of these same spirits.</p></blockquote>
<p>If my soul really did leave the body, and this experience is similar to actual physical death, the best analogy I can give to dying is trying to squeeze a marble through a thin straw. Initially, there was the feeling that I was losing gradual awareness and control over my body, including a cessation of sensory feedback, including pain, then a tightness and squeezing in the center of my body as I was being pushed through the &#8220;straw,&#8221; and then a feeling of traveling at rapid speed into another realm, like being blasted off into space. It&#8217;s disconcerting and strange but not painful or frightening. I never lost consciousness or awareness of what was happening, which we would expect because the soul is eternally awake, and the time it took to &#8220;die&#8221; (the progressive shutdown of my body), was short enough that there wasn&#8217;t an opportunity for fear, just confusion as to what was happening. It is possible that real death is a completely different experience, but from my reading of after-death experiences, it seems to be somewhat similar.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-15790 size-large" src="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-1024x717.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="497" srcset="https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-1536x1075.jpg 1536w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-2048x1434.jpg 2048w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-1060x742.jpg 1060w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-550x385.jpg 550w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-714x500.jpg 714w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-1920x1344.jpg 1920w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-1543x1080.jpg 1543w, https://www.rooshv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/space-tunnel-death-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>Second, once outside of the body, my soul enjoyed a feeling of joy and peacefulness since it was unencumbered by sins of the fallen flesh, which was especially true for me since at that time I was riddled with a lifetime of mortal sins that were not yet cleansed through the sacraments of the Church. Father Seraphim shares that once outside of the body, you will experience less of your fallen nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our physical bodies in this fallen world are bodies of pain, corruption, and death. When separated from this body, the soul is immediately in a state more &#8220;natural&#8221; to it, closer to the state God intends for it; for the resurrected &#8220;spiritual body&#8221; in which man will dwell in the Kingdom of Heaven has more in common with the soul than with the body we know on earth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most out-of-body stories of near-death experiences are positive because they describe the soul freely floating in the aerial realm (before any type of judgment takes place). Unless we have lived the lives of saints, our fallen bodies are opposed to the desires of the soul, so coming out of that body feels like taking off tight clothes. Even if you&#8217;re on your way to hell, for the time before the demons come to take you, you will feel free and joyful at the shedding of your flesh. If you&#8217;ve lived a holy life in the body then being out of the body may not offer a stark increase in the joy you perceive, since your body was already subverted to your soul&#8217;s desire to be in communion with God.</p>
<p>Third, I believe the vision I had with a dome containing a white light was either a projection of my preexisting belief of the afterlife or a deception by the demons to trick me into believing pantheistic notions. According to Father Seraphim, afterlife experiences are usually deceptions.</p>
<blockquote><p>…most, perhaps indeed all, of [near-death] experiences have little in common with the Christian vision of heaven. These visions are not spiritual, but worldly. They are so quick, so easily attained, so common, so earthly in their imagery, that there can be no serious comparison of them with the true Christian visions of heaven in the past… Even the most &#8220;spiritual&#8221; thing about some of them&#8212;the feeling of the &#8220;presence&#8221; of Christ&#8212;persuades one more of the spiritual immaturity of those who experience it than of anything else. Rather than producing the profound awe, fear of God, and repentance which the authentic experience of God&#8217;s presence has evoked in Christians saints (of which St. Paul&#8217;s experience on the road to Damascus may be taken as a model&#8212;Acts 9:3-9), the present-day experiences produce something much more akin to the &#8220;comfort&#8221; and &#8220;peace&#8221; of the modern spiritistic and Pentecostal movements.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>…we must clearly distinguish between genuine, grace-given visions of the other world, and a merely natural experience which, even though it may be outside the normal limits of human experience, is not in the least spiritual and tells us nothing about the actual reality of either the heaven or the hell of authentic Christian teaching.</p></blockquote>
<p>My initial interpretation was that it was a vision from God, because I so strongly craved God at that time, but I no longer believe this interpretation to be absolutely the case because of my then gross impurity and the vague nature of the vision. Visions given by God as described <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/the-field-of-spiritual-warfare">by Orthodox elders</a> are usually quite descriptive and vivid, not vague and open to multiple interpretations as if it were <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/its-not-easy-to-escape-from-the-occult">a palm reading</a>. For many years before this experience, I had been closely following Zen and Buddhist ideas of the afterlife that detailed the &#8220;collective unconscious&#8221; and going back to the &#8220;source,&#8221; so when I saw the dome, I thought it was the source of all creation, somewhat matching Eastern teachings, but I was so zealous for the real God at the time that I eventually interpreted the vision as being from a personal God. The most neutral possible interpretation is that the dome was something like space junk in the aerial realm.</p>
<p>When someone begins <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/are-you-on-the-path-to-salvation">a life of repentance</a>, they can be given a heavy dose of zeal and often grace. It was while in a state of zealousness that I took the drug and saw the vision, and so I believe that this state blocked me from interpreting it in a way that would steer me away from God. I say this because the psychedelic experience did not veer me off the path to getting baptized into the Orthodox Church <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/why-i-left-the-armenian-church-for-rocor">two years later</a>. I hesitate to say it helped me, but it did allow me to more quickly come to believe in a concrete spiritual reality, in which I had a weak belief at the time. Unfortunately for the vast majority of people, psychedelic experiences more often create mistaken notions of a spiritual reality and pull them away from God into beliefs closely aligned with deism, pantheism, or Buddhism, with the associated universalist belief that &#8220;everyone goes to heaven&#8221; or &#8220;everyone will be in peace after death.&#8221; If this deception is not corrected, a person&#8217;s soul is likely to be damned upon death.</p>
<p>From Father Seraphim:</p>
<blockquote><p>It may be asked: What of the feelings of ‘peace’ and ‘pleasantness’ which seem to be almost universal in the ‘out-of-body’ state. What of the vision of ‘light’ which so many see? Are these only deceptions also?</p>
<p>In a sense, it may be, these experiences are ‘natural’ to the soul when separated from the body. Our physical bodies in this fallen world are bodies of pain, corruption, and death. When separated from this body, the soul is immediately in a state more ‘natural’ to it, closer to the state God intends for it; for the resurrected ‘spiritual body’ in which man will dwell in the Kingdom of Heaven has more in common with the soul than with the body we know on earth&#8230;. In this sense, the ‘peace’ and ‘pleasantness’ of the out-of-body experience may be considered real and not a deception. Deception enters in, however, the instant one begins to interpret these ‘natural’ feelings as something ‘spiritual’&#8212;as though this peace were the true peace of reconciliation with God, and the ‘pleasantness’ were the true spiritual pleasure of heaven. This is, in fact, how many people interpret their ‘out-of-body’ and ‘after-death’ experiences, because of their lack of true spiritual experience and awareness.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I see my psychedelic experience as a form of chemically-induced pseudo-grace. I used a chemical and happened to luck out that I didn&#8217;t have more of a standard experience that would keep me turned away from the Lord God. I attribute this entirely to the fact that I was in a new state of bountiful and genuine zeal at the time and God was closely watching over his idiotic servant. Since then, I&#8217;ve had potent spiritual experiences within the Orthodox Church, without using any type of drug, so it was wholly unnecessary to get blasted off into the aerial realm by using a poison for what amounted to a fireworks show for a man who denied fireworks for much of his life. In fact, I have had spiritual experiences in the body where the joy I felt exceeded the joy felt while out of the body induced by my experience of chemical intoxication, negating any temptation to try a psychedelic drug again.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I got lucky, and cannot claim that I saw God or the source of all creation. I did experience something I suspect is close to bodily death, but the vision that followed was likely a demonic attempt to put me back into agnostic or gnostic notions of reality. Thankfully, my hunger for God was so great that I was able to get on the normal path of developing spiritual life as prescribed by Lord Jesus Christ and the Church He created for us, and two years after the experience I was received into that Church. If I hadn&#8217;t typed out <a href="https://www.rooshv.com/what-happened-when-i-took-psychedelic-mushrooms">a record of what happened</a>, I would hardly remember it, signifying how unimportant it was in my path to the Orthodox Church and developing faith in Lord Jesus Christ. Visions under chemical intoxication will not at all compare to what God can give you when He deems you ready.</p>
